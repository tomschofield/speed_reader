AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS ESSAY WAS PART OF ONGOING ELECTRONIC VOICE PHENOMENA BLOG (WWW. ELECTRONIC VOICE PHENOMENA. NET). THERE PROVED TO BE SUBSTANTIAL RESONANCE BETWEEN THIS ESSAY’S THEMATICS AND THE AUTHORS PRESENTATION AT THE TORQUE SYMPOSIUM. THIS TEXT IS THE OUTCOME OF THAT OVERLAP. THIS ESSAY WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN IN THE CONTEXT OF ELECTRONIC VOICE PHENOMENA – A PRACTICE USEFUL FOR THE ATTENTION IT DIRECTS TO ALTERITY. PUSHING PAST THE FIELDS ESOTERIC AND OCCULT TRAPPINGS PERMITS A FOCUS ON ANOTHER MARGINAL EXPERIENCE LADEN WITH WEIRDNESS – HEARING A VOICE WITHOUT AN OBVIOUS SOURCE OF EXTERIOR EMANATION. DECLARATIONS AND COMMANDS, OBVIOUSLY NOT OF ONE’S OWN VOICE, ISSUING FROM WITHIN YOUR OWN SKULL. UNRAVELLING WHY SUCH AN EXPERIENCE IS ERRONEOUSLY COMMENSURATE WITH ALTERITY POINTS TO AN UNDER ACKNOWLEDGED WAY OF ATTUNING TO ONES IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT. WITH THAT FACET OF OUR PSYCHE ACKNOWLEDGED THIS ESSAY WILL EXPLORE WHAT CONDITIONS, PRINCIPALLY TECHNOLOGICAL CONDITIONS, ARE CONDUCIVE TO ALTERNATIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL DISPOSITIONS TO IMMEDIACY. TECHNOLOGY IS DEEMED INSEPARABLE FROM BEING HUMAN, AND ACCORDINGLY CONSIDERED IN BROAD TERMS. MUCH OF THIS ESSAY’S AMBITION IS COMPLEMENTARY TO EXTENDED MIND THEORISATIONS (ELSEWHERE ELABORATED IN THIS PUBLICATION). THE FIRST AIM IS TO ENABLE SPECULATION ON HOW THE TECHNOLOGICAL MEDIATION INHERENT TO OUR DAILY LIVES MIGHT SPEAK THROUGH US IN NEW WAYS. OUR WAKING HOURS ARE MODULATED BY THE EDIFICES AND INFRASTRUCTURES WROUGHT THROUGH AND BY OUR TECHNOLOGIES, AND THOSE SAME MODULATIONS SET THE PARAMETERS FOR WHAT DEGREES OF ACTION (AND CHANGE) ARE POSSIBLE TO US. TO STEP OUTSIDE THOSE PARAMETERS, SHOULD THEY BE UNACCEPTABLE TO US, OR INDEED SHOULD NECESSITY DEMAND IT, ENTAILS FINDING NEW FLOWS OF THOUGHT, PREMONITIONS OF ALTERNATE MODES OF BEING-IN- WORLD, DIFFERENT SUBJECTIVITIES. SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL REORIENTATION REGARDING ONES TECHNOLOGICALLY SATURATED WORLD HAS BEEN DECLARED AN IMPERATIVE BY SCHOLARS OF THE POST HUMANITIES (MOST STIRRINGLY BY ROSI BRAIDOTTI) (BRAIDOTTI, THE POSTHUMAN) - THIS ESSAY’S SECOND AIM SEEKS TO LINK THIS IMPERATIVE TO HISTORICAL PRECEDENT FOR SUCH RECONFIGURATIONS OF MIND. HEARING VOICES IS A SYMPTOM OF SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS. IT NUMBERS AS ONE OF MANY FORMS OF HALLUCINATION WHICH THE SCHIZOPHRENIC SUBJECT MAY EXPERIENCE. HALLUCINATIONS ARE CATEGORISED WITHIN THE ‘POSITIVE SYMPTOMS’ OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. NIMH DISTINGUISHES ‘POSITIVE SYMPTOMS’ THUSLY: “POSITIVE SYMPTOMS ARE PSYCHOTIC BEHAVIOURS NOT SEEN IN HEALTHY PEOPLE”. (“WHAT IS SCHIZOPHRENIA?”.) THERE IS A SENSE OF SURPLUS HERE,THAT THE EXPERIENCES OF HALLUCINATIONS, DELUSIONS, AND ‘THOUGHT & MOVEMENT DISORDERS’ ARE EXCESSES WHICH NON-PATHOLOGICAL COGNITION NEVER NEEDS TO BUFFER. HALLUCINATIONS ARE NOT LIMITED TO HEARING VOICES, BUT THEY ARE THE MOST PREVALENT REGISTER OF HALLUCINATION DIAGNOSED IN SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS. MORE IMPORTANTLY HOWEVER HAS BEEN RECOGNITION (ACCENTUATED IN THE LAST THREE DECADES) THAT VOICE HEARING IS NOT LIMITED TO PATIENTS EXPERIENCING SCHIZOPHRENIA. THE HEARING VOICES NETWORK (“HEARING VOICES NETWORK.”) DEVELOPED FOLLOWING THE RESEARCH OF TWO DUTCH PSYCHIATRISTS, MARIUS ROMME AND SANDRA ESCHER, WHO HAD REVEALED THAT MANY MORE MEMBERS OF THE POPULATION HEARD VOICES THAN HAD EVER BEEN PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED (ROMME AND ESCHER, ACCEPTING VOICES.). THE HEARING VOICES NETWORK IS AN IMPORTANT INITIATIVE ALLOWING THOSE WHO HEAR VOICES TO COPE WITH THEIR EXPERIENCES BY NAMING THE VOICES THEY HEAR: IDENTIFYING THEM THROUGH HISTORICAL OR EMOTIONAL POINTS OF REFERENCE, AND IMBUING THE COMMUNICATION WITH MEANING. PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, ITS A PROCESS WHICH PROVIDES THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS TO THE PATIENT WITHOUT ENTAILING AN ATTENDANT PSYCHO-PHARMACEUTICAL REGIMEN. PROFESSOR LISA BLACKMAN WORKED WITH THE GROUP DURING ITS FORMATIVE YEARS. FOR BLACKMAN “VOICE HEARING IS A MODALITY OF KNOWING (THAT) CANNOT BE REDUCED TO IRRATIONALITY OR DISEASE”. (BLACKMAN, IMMATERIAL BODIES.) BLACKMAN’S EARLIER RESEARCH WITH THE HEARING VOICES NETWORK (BLACKMAN, HEARING VOICES.) ESTABLISHES THAT THE SYMPTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION OF VOICE HEARING IN CONVENTIONAL PSYCHIATRY CANNOT CONTAIN OR EXPLAIN THE MANY OCCASIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCE WHEREIN VOICE HEARING IS PART OF THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE. THE NON-PATHOLOGICAL FRAMING OF AUDITORY HALLUCINATION IS A CENTRAL PART OF JULIAN JAYNES’ MAVERICK MANUSCRIPT ON THE ORIGINS OF CONSCIOUSNESS THE ORIGIN OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE BREAKDOWN OF THE BICAMERAL MIND.(JAYNES, THE ORIGIN OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE BREAKDOWN OF THE BICAMERAL MIND. 8. CLASS ON CREATIVE READING - WILLIAM S. BURROUGHS.) JAYNES’ THESIS IS TRANSFIXING: IN HIS VIEW, PRIOR TO APPROXIMATELY 1000BC HUMANS WERE NOT CONSCIOUS AS YOU AND YOUR CONTEMPORARIES ARE CONSCIOUS! THROUGH CONDUCTING A COGNITIVE ARCHEOLOGY OF EARLY WESTERN CIVILISATIONS HE ARRIVES AT THE CONCLUSION THAT CONSCIOUSNESS WAS RADICALLY DIFFERENT PRIOR TO THE ADVENT OF WRITTEN CULTURES, PHENOMENOLOGICALLY AKIN TO COMMAND AND RESPONSE UTTERANCES RELAYED BETWEEN SEPARATE ENTITIES HOUSED WITHIN THE SAME SKULL! IT’S A RADICAL CLAIM, ONE THAT EVINCED SKEPTICISM AMONG CRITICS, AND IT REMAINS NO LESS CONTENTIOUS TODAY. (WILLIAM BURROUGHS AND RICHARD DAWKINS, IN THE GOD DELUSION (DAWKINS, THE GOD DELUSION P350.) HAVE RESPECTIVELY ATTESTED TO THE INFLUENCE AND NOTORIETY OF THE HYPOTHESIS). JAYNES’ THESIS IS HERE ADOPTED AS PLAUSIBLE INSOFAR AS IT AFFORDS SCOPE FOR SPECULATION UPON OUR PRESENT RELATION TO TECHNOLOGY. IN JAYNES ACCOUNT TECHNOLOGICAL DISRUPTION, IN THE FORM OF WRITING, WAS THE IMPETUS FOR THE CHANGE IN CONSCIOUSNESS. JAYNES IDENTIFIES THE LACK OF WHAT WE COULD DEEM ‘THE SELF’, OR SUBJECTIVITY, IN CULTURAL ARTEFACTS FROM ANCIENT CIVILISATIONS. HE MELDS THIS (ELSEWHERE NOTED) (HELLER-ROAZEN, THE INNER TOUCH.) ABSENCE OF CONTEMPORARY SELF CONSCIOUSNESS WITH THE THEORIES OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AVAILABLE TO HIM WHEN HE WROTE THE BOOK IN THE SEVENTIES (IT’S WORTH NOTING THAT MANY OF JAYNES PREDICTIONS – PERTAINING PARTICULARLY TO AURAL HALLUCINATIONS – WERE CONFIRMED BY LATER BRAIN IMAGING RESEARCH). (SHER, “NEUROIMAGING, AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS, AND THE BICAMERAL MIND.”) FROM THIS HE POSITS THE BI-CAMERAL MIND – A METAPHORIC CONCEPTION OF MIND BASED ON A BRAIN WHERE THE TWO HEMISPHERES WERE PARTITIONED AND NOT AN INTEGRATED COMMUNICATING UNIT. BICAMERAL HUMANS INSTEAD OPERATED BY MEANS OF AUTOMATIC, NONCONSCIOUS HABIT-SCHEMAS. WHEN HABIT WAS INSUFFICIENT TO “NOVEL CIRCUMSTANCES OR STRESSORS FACING THE HUMAN”, THE STRESS GRIPPING THE BICAMERAL SUBJECT CAUSED NEURAL ACTIVITY IN THE DOMINANT, HABITUAL, HEMISPHERE TO BE MODULATED BY AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS EMANATING FROM THE SILENT HEMISPHERE. IN ‘DO OR DIE’ CRUNCH MOMENTS BICAMERAL HUMANS WOULD HALLUCINATE THE ORDERS REQUISITE TO SURVIVAL. JAYNES’ CITES THE ATTRIBUTION OF VOLITION TO GODS IN ANCIENT ICONOGRAPHY (AND WITHIN THE HOMERIC ILIAD) AS EVIDENCE FOR SUCH EXPERIENCES, REASONING THAT PERSISTENTLY HALLUCINATED VOICES WOULD BE COLLECTIVELY ATTRIBUTED TO SOME CONSISTENT EMANATION. IN JAYNES’ ACCOUNT VERBAL COMMUNICATION AND SOCIETAL COORDINATION PROVIDED THE FIRST CONSENSUAL HALLUCINATION. TWO THINGS FROM JAYNES THESIS ARE RELEVANT TO THIS ESSAY’S ENQUIRY. JAYNES ELABORATES THAT THE HIERARCHICAL ORGANISATION OF SOCIETIES DURING THIS PERIOD (10000BC – 1000BC) WERE LIKEWISE DETERMINED BY THE TENDENCY TO HALLUCINATE ORDERS FROM A LOCI OF SUBJECTIVITY PERCEIVED AS ‘OTHER’ TO ONE’S INTERNAL HABITUAL SCHEMA. THIS RESULTED NOT JUST IN A PANOPOLY OF POLYTHEIST ENTITIES, BUT ALSO GOD-KINGS AND THE RULE OF LAW UBIQUITOUS TO MESOPOTAMIAN (AND OTHER CONTEMPORANEOUS) CIVILISATIONS. SECOND IS JAYNES’ IMPETUS FOR THE MORPHING OF BICAMERAL COGNITION INTO OUR ‘MODERN MIND’. A LAMENTATION OF BLACK SWANS (ENVIRONMENTAL TUMULT AND WRITING-AS-DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY AMONG THEM) CAUSED BICAMERAL COGNITION TO MALFUNCTION. ORACLES, DIVINATION AND OTHER CULTURAL MECHANISMS MUSHROOMED TO HELP SOCIETIES OF INDIVIDUALS ACCUSTOMED TO HOLDING PRIVATE DIALOGUE WITH THEIR GODS COPE WITH THEIR INTERNAL VOICES FALLING SILENT. WRITING WAS CRUCIAL IN THE BREAKDOWN OF THE BICAMERAL MIND BECAUSE IT WEAKENED WHAT HAD BEEN AN EXCLUSIVELY AUDITORY CULTURE PRIOR TO ITS ADVENT. THIS RESONATES WITH OTHER SCHOLARS (SUCH AUTHORS MIGHT INCLUDE MARSHALL MCLUHAN (1964), WALTER ONG (1982), NEIL POSTMAN (1985), MERLIN MCDONALD (1991)) WHO HAVE STRESSED WRITING AS DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY CAPABLE OF REWIRING ITS USERS. JAYNES’ THESIS, ENTERTAINED AS PLAUSIBLE, SUGGESTS THAT THE REOCCURRENCE OF A MIND REORGANISATION IS POSSIBLE AGAIN, GIVEN THE RIGHT CONDITIONS. WHICH IS NOT SUCH A RADICAL CLAIM IF YOU’VE READ SHERRY TURKLE’S EARLIER TECHNOLOGICALLY-EVANGELIC TEXTS (TURKLE, THE SECOND SELF. LIFE ON THE SCREEN) OR ARE ACQUAINTED WITH ENTHEOGENIC MANIFESTOS THAT TREAT PSYCHEDELICS AS ‘BRAIN TECHNOLOGY’.(DOYLE, DARWIN’S PHARMACY.) SPECULATION ON WHETHER OUR CONSCIOUSNESS CAN BE TRANSFORMED WITH THE AID OF SOME TECHNOLOGICAL PROSTHESIS HAS CAPTIVATED THE IMAGINATIONS OF THE COUNTER CULTURE, PHILOSOPHERS, AND LIBERTARIANS IN EQUAL MEASURE. TIMOTHY CROW’S CONCEPT OF ‘CEREBRAL TORQUE’ (CROW, “THE CEREBRAL TORQUE AND DIRECTIONAL ASYMMETRY FOR HAND USE ARE CORRELATES OF THE CAPACITY FOR LANGUAGE IN HOMO SAPIENS.”) PRESENTS THE EMERGENCE OF PREHISTORIC NEUROTYPICALITY (SCHIZOPHRENIC VERSUS ‘PROPERLY LATERALISED’ BRAINS) WHICH FOLLOWED IN THE WAKE OF GENETIC CHANGES EVINCING BRAIN LATERALISATION. IN CROW’S ACCOUNT GENETIC INSCRIPTION PRECEDES SOCIETAL CONSEQUENCE – IN JAYNES’ ACCOUNT EXTERNALISED INSCRIPTIONS PROVOKES BOTH PSYCHIC AND SOCIETAL REORGANISATION. FOR BOTH AUTHORS SCHIZOPHRENIA PRESENTS A PHENOMENOLOGICAL EDGE CASE OF IMPORT. THEIR RESPECTIVE PERIODS OF INVESTIGATION COVER THE FIRST TWO PHASES OF ROBERT K LOGAN’S SUCCESSION OF EXTENDED MIND TECHNOLOGIES: SPEECH, WRITING, MATH, SCIENCE, COMPUTING AND THE INTERNET. LOGAN CONSIDERS EACH EXTENDED MIND TECHNOLOGY AS INFORMATIC SYSTEMS THAT INCREASE IN COMPLEXITY AND THUS AUTO-CATALYTICALLY ENSURE THE GENERATION OF THEIR SUCCESSOR. JAYNES’ WORK IS AN INTERESTING FOIL TO CROW’S SPECULATION THAT SCHIZOPHRENIA (OR MIS-LATERALISED BRAINS) IS THE ‘PRICE PAID FOR LANGUAGE’. INSTEAD JAYNES PRESENTS A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF SOCIETAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT GREW AROUND A NOW SUPERSEDED PARADIGM OF COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION. IT WOULD BE HARD TO ASSERT WHETHER THE EMOTIONAL, INTELLECTUAL AND CREATIVE CAPACITIES TODAY CONSIDERED AS IMPAIRED IN SCHIZOPHRENIA (AT LEAST IN CROW’S ACCOUNT) WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKEWISE ABERRANT OR NON-FUNCTIONAL IN A PRIOR EXTENDED MIND PARADIGM SUCH AS THE BICAMERAL BRAIN SOCIETY DESCRIBED BY JAYNES. IN THE LATTER’S ACCOUNT THERE DEVELOPED NUMEROUS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OUT OF ‘LANGUAGE’ BUT THEY WERE ONLY MADE EVIDENT WHEN WRITING DISRUPTED THE SHARED MEANS OF PARSING REALITY. IN THE PARLANCE OF THE COMPLEXITY THEORY DISCOURSE WHICH UNDERPINS LOGAN’S FIGURATION OF EXTENDED MIND, JAYNES THESIS CAN BE READ AS A DETAILED AND RIGOROUS RUMINATION ON THE PSYCHIC FALLOUT OF A BIFURCATION POINT IN THE INFORMATIONAL COMPLEXITY OF EARLY HUMANITIES EXTENDED MIND. IN SO DOING, IT PROVIDES A BENCHMARK FOR WHAT CHANGES OTHER INFORMATIC EXTENDED MIND OVERHAULS COULD ENTAIL. IT’S THE ATTUNEMENT TO ALTERITY, AND THE ALIGNMENT OF CORPOREALLY DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY TO SOCIETAL UPHEAVAL AND CRISIS IN JAYNES’ ACCOUNT THAT SUGGEST HIS FRAMEWORK AS PERTINENT TO EVALUATING CONTEMPORARY CIRCUMSTANCES. THE CONTENTION FROM HERE ON OUT IS THAT WE MIGHT JUST BE APPROACHING ANOTHER COGNITIVE REORGANISATION – AND SO CLARITY ABOUT WHAT CRITERIA CONSTITUTES COMPARABLE CONDITIONS IS IMPORTANT. THE BICAMERAL SUBJECT FADED BECAUSE THE HUMAN SUBJECT INTERACTED WITH A CHANGED EXTERIOR WORLD, PROMPTING SIGNALS WITHIN THE BRAIN TO BE MORE INTEGRATED. THIS IS THE CONTENTION OF JAYNES, THAT THE TWO BRAIN HEMISPHERES WOULD INCREASINGLY RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER AS PARTS OF A WHOLE, RATHER THAN PURELY BICAMERAL. INTEGRATED IS THE KEY CONCEPT HERE – IT SUGGESTS THE TANTALISING PROSPECT OF WHAT MIGHT BE GAINED BY READING THE WORK OF MEDIA-ECOLOGISTS WHO LEANED TOWARDS INFORMATIC DISCOURSE ALONGSIDE THE THESIS OF INTEGRATED INFORMATION. THIS MATHEMATICAL THEORY, DEVELOPED BY GIULIO TONONI (TONONI, “CONSCIOUSNESS AS INTEGRATED INFORMATION: A PROVISIONAL MANIFESTO.”) AND RECENTLY EXTRAPOLATED BY MAX TEGMARK (TEGMARK, “CONSCIOUSNESS AS A STATE OF MATTER.”) PROVIDES DETERMINING CRITERIA OF THE POINT AT WHICH A SYSTEM BECOMES CONSCIOUS (AGAIN JAYNES WAS PRESCIENT IN THIS REGARD – CHRISTIAN KOCH POSITS THE MEASURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS AS CORRELATED TO THE LEVEL OF INTEGRATION INHERENT TO A SYSTEM – HTTP: //WWW.WIRED. COM/ WIRED SCIENCE/ 2013/11/ CHRISTOF- KOCH - PANPSYCHISM - CONSCIOUSNESS / 19. TEGMARK ADDS THREE ADDITIONAL CRITERIA - INDEPENDENCE, DYNAMICS, AND UTILITY PRINCIPLE)  - WITH INTEGRATION OF INFORMATION KEY.19 IF CONSCIOUSNESS IS A MEASURE OF THE INTEGRATION, OR AN EPIPHENOMENA COUPLED TO THE LEVEL OF INTEGRATION IN A GIVEN SYSTEM, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR ANIMALS (HUMANS) THAT CAN BOTH ENROLL EXTERNAL TOOLS (TODAY POSSESSED OF THEIR OWN INHERENT INFORMATION) INTO THEIR BODY SCHEMA, AND WHO HAVE AN ABILITY TO DEVELOP SOCIETAL AND INFRASTRUCTURAL ABSTRACTIONS – THAT PROVIDE A MEASURE OF PERSISTENCE – BASED ON TOOLS WHERE THERE IS A BASELINE SATURATION POINT OF COMPETENCY? INTEGRATED INFORMATION THEORY DANGLES THE POSSIBILITY OF A CONTINUUM OF INFORMATIC COMPREHENSION, BETWEEN OUR EXTERNAL WORLD AND THE WETWARE MECHANISMS BY WHICH THAT EXTERNAL WORLD COMES TO BE SENSIBLE AND MALLEABLE TO US. WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH ‘THE SELF’ OR THE ‘MODERN MIND’ RELATIVE TO WHAT (POTENTIALLY) PRECEDED IT IN THE BICAMERAL HUMAN IS THAT PRIOR CHANGES IN THAT INTEGRATED INFORMATION CONTINUUM MAY HAVE PRODUCED DIFFERENT ‘SELFS’ (FOR WANT OF A BETTER WORD). TO CONCEIVE OF THE ‘MODERN MIND’ PARSING REALITY AS A SYSTEM OF BRAIN-BODY-WORLD IS CONSISTENT WITH THE EMBODIED COGNITION PERSPECTIVE OF COGNITIVE SCIENCE. THE IDEA HAS GAINED PURCHASE WITH SOME NEUROSCIENTISTS AND AI RESEARCHERS, PRECISELY BECAUSE IT LETS YOU CONCEIVE OF AN ORGANISM’S EXISTENCE IN ITS IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT IN WAYS DIFFERENT FROM THE “BRAIN IN THE VAT” CONCEPTION THAT THE CARTESIAN MIND-BODY SPLIT (AND ITS CONCEPTUAL DESCENDANTS) ENTAILS. GILBERT SIMONDON’S THEORY OF INVIDUATION (SIMONDON, “GILBERT SIMONDON.”) OFFERS CONCEPTUAL PURCHASE ON THE “-WORLD” PORTION OF THE BRAIN-BODY-WORLD SYSTEM. INDIVIDUATION IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH SUBJECTS BECOME DISTINGUISHED (AS IN DISTINCT, RATHER THAN RENOWNED) FROM THEIR ENVIRONMENT. IN SIMONDONIAN TERMS, WHAT THE SUBJECT INDIVIDUATES FROM IS TERMED THE PRE-INDIVIDUAL: A SET OF EXTRA-BODILY FORCES – A MILIEUX – INCLUDING SOCIETAL NORMS, TECHNOLOGY, AND INTERACTIONS WITH HUMAN AND NON HUMAN OTHERS. IMPORTANTLY, THE PRE-INDIVIDUAL PRECEDES AND EXCEEDS ANY INDIVIDUATED ENTITY. SIMONDON CONSIDERS TECHNOLOGY AS A FUNDAMENTALLY INSEPARABLE PART OF BEING HUMAN. HIS ‘GENERAL PHENOMENOLOGY OF MACHINES’ EMPHASISES THE AGENCY OF TECHNOLOGY AND RESISTS ACCOUNTS WHICH TREAT TECHNOLOGY AS MERE UTILITY. TECHNOLOGY IS INHERENT TO HOW ‘WE ARE’ IN THE WORLD AROUND US. SIMONDON’S ‘PRE-INDIVIDUAL’ GOES A STEP BEYOND A COMPARABLE CONCEPT: JAKOB VON UEXKÜLL’S UMWELT. (VON UEXKÜLL, “A STROLL THROUGH THE WORLDS OF ANIMALS AND MEN: A PICTURE BOOK OF INVISIBLE WORLDS.”) THE UMWELT WAS NICELY DESCRIBED BY DAWKINS IN HIS ‘MIDDLE WORLD RUMINATION’, WHICH IS QUOTED AT LENGTH. “WHAT WE SEE OF THE REAL WORLD IS NOT THE UNVARNISHED WORLD BUT A MODEL OF THE WORLD, REGULATED AND ADJUSTED BY SENSE DATA, BUT CONSTRUCTED SO IT’S USEFUL FOR DEALING WITH THE REAL WORLD. MIDDLE WORLD — THE RANGE OF SIZES AND SPEEDS WHICH WE HAVE EVOLVED TO FEEL INTUITIVELY COMFORTABLE WITH – IS A BIT LIKE THE NARROW RANGE OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM THAT WE SEE AS LIGHT OF VARIOUS COLOURS. WE’RE BLIND TO ALL FREQUENCIES OUTSIDE THAT, UNLESS WE USE INSTRUMENTS TO HELP US. MIDDLE WORLD IS THE NARROW RANGE OF REALITY WHICH WE JUDGE TO BE NORMAL, AS OPPOSED TO THE QUEERNESS OF THE VERY SMALL, THE VERY LARGE AND THE VERY FAST.” (DAWKINS, “WHY THE UNIVERSE SEEMS SO STRANGE.”) BOTH THE UMWELT AND SIMONDON’S INDIVIDUATION ARE EXPANSIVE IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY ENCOMPASS – THE HUMAN SUBJECT IS BUT ONE OF MANY ENTITIES INDIVIDUATING IN THE WORLD. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS ESSAY I’M CONFLATING ONE’S SELF WITH ONE’S INDIVIDUATION, AND A READING OF THAT THEORY WOULD ELUCIDATE THAT SOME NUANCE IS ELIDED IN SUCH A CONFLATION. (ONE MIGHT MORE PRODUCTIVELY CONSIDER THE SELF AS THE PROVIDED INTERFACE WE HAVE TO OUR INDIVIDUATION) INDIVIDUATION LETS US ENTERTAIN THE SELF AS WE ASSUME ONE ANOTHER TO EXPERIENCE IT: AS A PROCESS, NOT THE DEFINITIVE OUTCOME. THIS CONSEQUENTIAL FIGURATION OF SELF IS SOMEWHAT ALIGNED WITH NEUROSCIENCE AND COGNITIVE SCIENCE. BOTH APPROACHES ASSURE US, IN THEIR OWN WAY, THAT ‘THE SELF’ IS AN EPIPHENOMENA OF THE MECHANISMS OF COGNITIVE ACTIVITY. SIMONDON’S INCLUSION OF TECHNOLOGY WITHIN HIS MILIEUX OF EXTERIOR FORCES (THAT CO-CONSTITUTE OUR INTERIOR SENSE OF SELF - OUR INDIVIDUATION) ALLOWS US TO COMPREHEND BEYOND THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS WHICH DAWKINS INTIMATES IN THE ABOVE PASSAGE. AS THE BREADTH AND COMPLEXITY OF OUR INSTRUMENTATION SOPHISTICATES THE TOPOGRAPHY OF ‘MIDDLE WORLD’ ACCESSIBLE TO US IS TRANSFIGURED. WE SHOULD EXPECT THIS TO IMPACT OUR SENSE OF SELF, GIVEN THE FEEDBACK OCCURRING BETWEEN THE WORLD EXTERIOR TO OUR PERCEPTION AND OUR CONSTRUCTION OF OUR OWN ‘MIDDLE WORLDS’. FROM A SIMONDONIAN PERSPECTIVE, YOU COULD CONSIDER WRITING AS A NEW TECHNOLOGICAL FACTOR IN THE PRE- INDIVIDUAL FIELDS WHICH THE BICAMERAL SUBJECT WAS ACCUSTOMED TO INDIVIDUATING FROM. THE SLOW DEVELOPMENT OF WRITING INTO A UBIQUITOUS TECHNOLOGY REORDERED PEDAGOGY, POLITICS, SOCIETAL ORGANISATION AND MANY OTHER DOMAINS WHICH WERE LIKEWISE PART OF THE COLLECTIVE PRE-INDIVIDUAL. EACH BRAIN-BODY-WORLD SYSTEM COULD INTEGRATE THE SUM TOTAL OF INCOMING INFORMATION IN DIFFERENT MEANS. DANIEL DENNET LIKENS THE REORGANISATION TO THE EPIPHANY ONE CAN EXPERIENCE SHIFTING FROM PROCEDURAL PROGRAMMING TO CODING IN LISP. (DENNETT, “JULIAN JAYNES’ SOFTWARE ARCHAEOLOGY.”) DENNET’S CONTRIBUTION IS IMPORTANT AS IT SUGGESTS THAT ABSTRACTION (IN THE FORM OF WRITING) COULD CHANGE PERCEPTION MORE FUNDAMENTALLY THAN THE GENETIC CHANGES THAT PERMITTING LATERALISATION AND LANGUAGE IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE BICAMERAL SUBJECT BEGAN TO ATROPHY AS IT WAS SUPPLANTED BY A DIFFERENT REGISTER OF CONSCIOUSNESS. JAYNES WAS WORKING ARCHAEOLOGICALLY AND THERE ARE LIMITS TO HOW FAR YOU CAN BELIEVE EDUCATED AND RIGOROUS GUESSWORK – FOR GUESSWORK IT SHALL ALWAYS REMAIN. BUT MAYBE WE COULD SKETCH HOW A COMPARABLE CRISIS OF UTILITY CONFRONTS OUR CONTEMPORARY SUBJECTIVITY: (NO ASSUMPTION IS MADE THAT EVERYONE POSSESES THE SAME SUBJECTIVITY – BUT THERE IS THE ASSUMPTION THAT ONE SUBJECTIVITY IS MORE PREDOMINANT AND HOMOGENOUS THAN MOST. THIS IS A NOT AN UNPROBLEMATIC ASSUMPTION. BLACKMAN, IMMATERIAL BODIES.) THE RATIONAL SENSE-OF-SELF? THIS IS NOT A DISCUSSION OF HOW THE INTERNET MASSAGES AND TWEAKS YOUR NEURAL PLASTICITY, BUT MORE AN OVERVIEW OF HOW THE SUM EFFECTS OF THE PRESENT DAY TECHNOLOGICAL CONDITION MIGHT RESEMBLE THE CONDITIONS WHICH ACCOMPANIED THE MILLENNIA LONG BREAKDOWN OF THE BICAMERAL MIND. THE ‘YEAR 0’ IS ACCORDINGLY FURTHER BACK THAN THE ADVENT OF COMPUTING AND THE INTERNET. SIMONDON’S ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THE STATE OF INDUSTRIALISED LABOUR AT THE TURN OF THE 20TH CENTURY AS A POINT OF ORIGIN. THIS PERIOD ROUGHLY APPROXIMATES TO WESTERN SOCIETY IN THE AFTERMATH OF DECADES OF INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION - A PERIOD WHERE AN ASSEMBLAGE OF TECHNOLOGIES HAD BECOME EMBEDDED INTO EVERYDAY LIFE AND PRACTICE. TIME HAD BEEN DISCIPLINED. SOCIAL STRATA WERE SHIFTED, INDEPENDENT OF THE NEED FOR PLAGUE OR WAR. WITHIN THIS PERIOD OF TECHNOLOGICAL RUPTURE, AND CORRESPONDING AFTERGLOW, SIMONDON CONTENDS THAT AN EMBODIED RELATIONSHIP TO TECHNOLOGY HAD BEEN LOST. SIMONDON DEEMS THAT ‘CORPOREAL SCHEMAS’ WERE REQUISITE TO A KNOWING, RATHER THAN UTILITARIAN (OR REACTIONARY), RELATIONSHIP TO TECHNOLOGY. SAID SCHEMAS WERE LOST IN THE SHUFFLE, FOLLOWING INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. A MARKER WAS LAID DOWN IN TERMS OF HOW TECHNOLOGY OPERATED WITHIN THE PRE- INDIVIDUAL MILIEUX. THE TURN OF THE 20TH CENTURY, ROUGHLY CONCURRENT WITH THE AFTERMATH OF AFOREMENTIONED CORPOREAL RUPTURE, WAS ALSO A PERIOD OF INTENSE INTEREST AS FAR AS HISTORIANS OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES ARE CONCERNED. IT WAS IN THIS PERIOD THAT EMPIRICAL INTEREST IN MEDIUMSHIP, SEANCE AND MESMERISM AND OTHER SPIRITUALIST PURSUITS WAS TO IRREVOCABLY ALTER THE TRAJECTORY OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES. LISA BLACKMAN’S RESEARCH OF THIS PERIOD TAKES US A STEP BEYOND THE CONTENTIONS OF THE BICAMERAL BRAIN. JAYNES’ EFFORTS ESTABLISHED VOICE HEARING AS A VESTIGE OF A SINCE SUPPLANTED MODE OF CONSCIOUSNESS. TO JAYNES, FRINGE AND PARA-PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF COGNITION WERE REMNANTS LEFT OVER FROM THE BICAMERAL BRAIN PERIOD, LIKE THE APPENDIX OF THE MIND. THE FLUX OF MIND INTIMATED BY INDIVIDUATION LETS US ENTERTAIN THAT THOSE PROCLIVITIES ARE NOT HARD CODED FOR REDUNDANCY, BUT PERHAPS LATENT FACULTIES AWAITING THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENTAL AFFORDANCES. BLACKMAN’S SCHOLARSHIP FOCUSES ON HOW TOPICS WHICH WE TODAY CONSIDER THE PRESERVE OF PARAPSYCHOLOGY – TELEPATHY, HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION, COMMUNICATING WITH THE DEAD – WERE SERIOUS TOPICS OF RESEARCH. THE RATIONALE WHICH SAW THOSE EXPERIENCES DISMISSED AS MARGINAL WAS EXPLICITLY TIED TO CONSTITUTING THE NORMALISED SUBJECT – THE BASELINE OR RATIFIED INDIVIDUATION IF YOU WILL – WITH WHICH WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO TODAY. SHE NOTES THAT “NEW TECHNOLOGICAL FORMS AND PRACTICES DEMANDED A SUBJECT WHO COULD ‘PAY ATTENTION’ IN WAYS WHICH WERE INTEGRAL TO NEW LABOUR AND EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES”.(IBID.) A SUBJECT THAT COULD IMPOSE THEIR WILL ON REALITY WAS CLOSEST TO IDEAL IN THAT REGARD, AND ALL ELSE THAT DIDN’T FIT AS SNUGLY FOUND ITSELF PATHOLOGISED, A TRAJECTORY THAT INTENSIFIED IN THE LATTER HALF OF THE LAST CENTURY.(CALIMAN, “A BIOLOGIA MORAL.”) WHERE JAYNES ENDEAVOURED TO DEPATHOLOGISE VOICE HEARING, BLACKMAN’S WORK (AND THAT OF LUCIANA VIEIRA CALIMAN29) UNEARTHS THE REASON WHY VOICE HEARING WAS PATHOLOGISED, UNPICKING THE GENDERED AND COLONIAL ASSUMPTIONS OF A SUBJECT CAPABLE OF IMPOSING THEIR WILL ON REALITY. IT HELPS ACCOUNT FOR SOME OF THE MORE EFFUSIVE AND OCCLUDED FORCES OPERATING WITHIN THE PRE-INDIVIDUAL FIELD FROM WHICH A SUBJECT CAN EMERGE. THESE ARE ASPECTS WHICH THIS ESSAY HAS NEGLECTED TO COVER IN THE DEPTH THEY REQUIRE, BUT WHICH ARE CRUCIAL TO ACCOUNT FOR. IT’S THOSE VISCOUS AND UNEASY TO ACCOUNT FOR FACTORS THAT HAVE FIREWALLED ASPECTS OF HUMAN PHENOMENOLOGICAL EXPERIENCE FROM THE SAME EMPIRICAL ENQUIRY APPLIED TO OTHER UNKNOWNS. IN OTHER CASES THEY HAVE HOBBLED THE MECHANISMS OF ENQUIRY. MOREOVER IT HIGHLIGHTS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL (OR PSYCHIC) CONSEQUENCE OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT WAS BECOMING UBIQUITOUS IN PEOPLES LIVES AND WHICH WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REORDERING LABOUR PRACTICE, THEIR DAILY INFRASTRUCTURE AND SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT. LET’S CONSIDER THAT THE UBIQUITY AND INDISPENSABILITY OF DISEMBODYING (IN SIMONDON’S MEANING) TECHNOLOGY TO EVERYDAY EXISTENCE FIRST EXPERIENCED DURING THE POST-INDUSTRIAL PERIOD HAS INTENSIFIED SINCE THE INVENTION OF COMPUTERS AND SUBSEQUENT DIGITAL MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES. LET’S ENTERTAIN THAT THIS PERIOD IS COMPARABLE IN TRAJECTORY AND INTENSITY (IF NOT YET EQUIVALENT IN DURATION) TO THE PERIOD WHICH SAW THE BREAKDOWN OF THE BICAMERAL MIND IN TERMS OF A POWERFUL CHANGE TO THE PRE-INDIVIDUAL MILIEUX. THE DRIVING IMPERATIVE IN REMOVING THE PATHOLOGY OF VOICE HEARING LETS US ACCEPT THAT THERE ARE FACULTIES AND FUNCTIONS OF MIND WHICH ESCAPE THE BOUNDS OF ‘WHAT ONCE MADE SENSE’. SUCH ACCEPTANCE MAY BE CRUCIAL TO BETTER ADAPTING TO OUR DIGITALLY MEDIATED EXISTENCE. THE JUNGIAN MODEL FIGURES INDIVIDUATION AS HOW THE INDIVIDUAL SELF DEVELOPS OUT OF AN UNDIFFERENTIATED UNCONSCIOUS. IF THE ‘INDIVIDUAL SELF’, THE MODERN MIND (ONE OF MANY POTENTIAL INDIVIDUATIONS), IS ON THE WANE, IN TERMS OF THE PURCHASE IT AFFORDS US ON OUR NEW TECHNOLOGICAL MILIEUX (LIKE THE BICAMERAL INDIVIDUATION THAT PRECEDED IT), THEN IT FOLLOWS WE NEED NEW FRAMEWORKS, NEW METACONCEPTS – IN SHORT, ALTERNATIVE INDIVIDUATIONS. A CRUCIAL STEP TO FORMULATING SUCH INDIVIDUATIONS INVOLVES ACKNOWLEDGING THE PSYCHIC CONTINUUM BETWEEN OUR MINDS AND OUR DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES. IF WE’RE TAKING SIMONDON’S WORK AS OUR MODEL FOR PSYCHE, THERE’S NO NEED TO INVOKE THE SINGULARITY AND PANPSYCHISM (THOUGH IT WOULD NO DOUBT BE INTRIGUING TO DO SO). LET’S ENTERTAIN THAT THERE IS A HOMOLOGY BETWEEN NEUROLOGICAL LOOPS THAT PRODUCE PERCEPTION, COMPUTATIONAL LOOPS THAT PRODUCE OUTPUTS FROM DELIMITED INPUTS AND INDIVIDUATING LOOPS THAT PRODUCE SUBJECTIVITY IN TANDEM WITH OUR EXTERIOR SOCIO TECHNOLOGICAL MILIEUX. JOE BANKS’ WORK ON ELECTRONIC VOICE PHENOMENA HIGHLIGHTS THE PRACTICE AS INDICATIVE OF THE BRAIN’S PATTERN SEEKING TYPICAL LOCATION EVENT LOOPS IN GUIS, SERVERS ... COUNTING, SORTING, INPUT AND OUTPUT TRANSFORMING GRID AND TABLE STRUCTURES SEARCHING AND SORTING OF TREE OR NETWORK STRUCTURES GOAL-SEEKING ALGORITHMS USER INTERFACES OR INTERACTION TYPE OF LOOP SIMPLE & INDEFINITE SIMPLE & DEFINITE NESTED & DEFINITE RECURSIVE RESULT CONTROLLED INTERACTIVE AND INDEFINITE BOUNDING CONDITION NO BOUNDING CONDITIONS BOUNDING CONDITIONS DETERMINED BY A FINITE SET OF ELEMENTS MULTIPLE BOUNDING CONDITIONS DEPTH OF POSSIBLE RECURSION (MEMORY OR TIME) LOOP ENDS WHEN SOME GOAL HAS BEEN REACHED BOUNDING CONDITIONS CHANGE DURING THE COURSE OF THE LOOP PREROGATIVE. FACED WITH A RANDOM STREAM OF NOISE THE HUMAN BRAIN IMPOSES PATTERN AND ORDER ON WHAT IT HEARS, DISCERNING VOICES AND ARTEFACTS THAT ARE NOT PRESENT ON THE MEDIA (A PROCESS DESCRIBED AS AUDITORY PAREIDOLIA AND APOPHENIA). BANKS’ AMBITIOUS CONTENTION IS THAT ALL AESTHETIC KNOWLEDGE IS INDEBTED TO FUNDAMENTAL PATTERN RECOGNITION MECHANISMS COMPARABLE TO APOPHENIA, THUS ‘THE CAPACITY TO FORM SUCH ILLUSIONS IS SHARED BY ALL PEOPLE AS AN IMPORTANT PART OF NORMAL PERCEPTION’.3(SUTCLIFFE, “TO WAGE WAR WITH GHOSTS: JOE BANKS OF DISINFORMATION INTERVIEWED.”) AND HERE IS AN INTIMATION OF CONSENSUAL HALLUCINATION ONCE MORE, AGAIN HELPING US FATHOM HOW JAYNES’ BICAMERAL HUMAN MIGHT EVER HAVE EXISTED. IF THE BRAIN IS CONSIDERED AS AN INFORMATION COMPUTING UNIT THEN ONE CAN REASON THAT THESE FACULTIES EMERGED IN ORDER TO HELP US MAKE SENSE OF A COMPLEX AND NOISY WORLD. THE CONTRAST WITH HEARING VOICES IN TECHNOLOGICAL MEDIA, SO THE CASE AGAINST THE VERACITY OF EVP STATES, IS THAT THIS INNATE ILLUSORY PERCEPTION IS PERMITTED TO STRAY BEYOND IT’S BOUNDARY CONDITIONS. APOPHENIA OF THIS SORT IS SUPERFICIAL ACCESS TO ONE FACET OF THE SCHIZOPHRENIC FORM OF INDIVIDUATION WHICH BOTH JAYNES AND CROW MADE USE OF. IN DELEUZE AND GUATTARI’S LONG CO- WRITING COLLABORATION SCHIZO-ANALYSIS IS EMPLOYED FOR THE ACCESS IT PROVIDES TO GENERATIVE SURPLUSES AND ‘LINES OF FLIGHT’ THAT EXCEED THE PRESUMED OPERATIVE DELIMITATIONS OF A GIVEN BODY – BE THAT A CORPOREAL, INSTITUTIONAL OR ABSTRACT BODY. AUTHOR GRANT MORRISON, SPOKE OF CHAOS MAGICK INITIATES EMPLOYING MULTIPLE PERSONALITY DISORDER (MPD) AS A LIFESTYLE CHOICE (METZGER AND MORRISON, BOOK OF LIES.) CHOICE (LIKELY AS A MEANS OF ATTAINING SOMETHING AKIN TO ROBERT ANTON WILSON’S MODEL AGNOSTICISM32). IN BOTH THE PRACTICE OF EVP ARTISTS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MORRISON’S CHAOS MAGICK INITIATE THERE IS A FLANEUR LIKE FIGURATION OF A SUBJECTS CAPABLE OF SAMPLING A REGISTER OF PERCEPTION NOT UNIVERSALLY SUPPORTED OR ENGAGED WITH. BY TOYING WITH THE GATES AND THRESHOLD OF ONES PERCEPTUAL FEEDBACK LOOPS NOVELTY CAN BE UNVEILED. IN MANY OF THE INSTANCES DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY THERE IS A SUBJECT GORGING ON APOPHENIA - ALBEIT IN DELIMITED FORM (ONLY IN THE OCCULT TRAPPINGS OF CHAOS MAGICK IS SCHIZOPHRENIC PERCEPTION FIGURED AS A HABITUATED PRACTICE DESIGNED TO REORIENT ONES DISPOSITION TO THE WORLD). ACCOUNTING FOR WHAT CURTAILS ONGOING ENGAGEMENT WITH THIS REGISTER OF REALITY SEEMS RELEVANT. BOUNDARY CONDITIONS, AS DESCRIBED IN ADRIAN MACKENZIE’S TYPOLOGY OF LOOPS (KRASSNER, PAUL. A PAUL KRASSNER INTERVIEW WITH ROBERT. ANTON. WILSON – HIGH TIMES, MARCH 2003 ISSUE 33. MAC KENZIE, MAKING DATA FLOW: ON THE IMPLICATIONS OF CODE LOOPS) (REPRODUCED ABOVE), CAN FRAME SUCH DELIMITING FACTORS. IN AN EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND THE AGENCY OF DIGITAL LOOPS (A MEANS OF ALGORITHMIC COMPUTATION AND THUS PRODUCTION) MACKENZIE POSITS THAT UNDERSTANDING THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS BY WHICH LOOPS ARE DELIMITED GRANTS USEFUL PURCHASE ON DIGITAL PROCESSES WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE EVADE PERCEPTION – WHETHER BY DINT OF THEIR SPEED OR THEIR EXECUTION NESTED WITHIN STACKS OF SOFTWARE. IN THE AFOREMENTIONED HOMOLOGY OF LOOPS, THIS METHODOLOGY IS OF MOST RELEVANCE TO INDIVIDUATING LOOPS THAT PRODUCE SUBJECTIVITY IN TANDEM WITH OUR EXTERIOR SOCIO TECHNOLOGICAL MILIEUX. SEEKING BOUNDARY CONDITIONS IN THE LATTER CATEGORY REQUIRES THE GREATEST EFFORT GIVEN THAT WE’RE DEALING WITH FUZZY CATEGORIES LIKE SOCIETAL NORMS, OPTIMAL PATTERNS OF LABOUR FOMENTED BY TECHNOLOGICAL AFFORDANCES & MARKET IMPERATIVES, AND CULTURAL ZEITGEISTS CREOLISED INTO ACCEPTED WISDOM. BUT WE MIGHT FIND IT PRODUCTIVE TO SEEK THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS WHICH A GIVEN INDIVIDUATED SUBJECT CLEAVES TO. IT COULD ACCOUNT FOR WHY A COMMONALITY OF SENSE-OF-SELF EXISTS. IT COULD GO SOMEWAY TOWARDS ANSWERING THE QUESTION WHICH LISA BLACKMAN PURSUES IN MUCH OF HER RECENT RESEARCH - “HOW DO WE LIVE SINGULARITY IN THE FACE OF MULTIPLICITY?” FOR EACH LOOP, THERE ARE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS WHICH DETERMINE ITS TERMINATION. FOR INSTANCE, SOME PRE-INDIVIDUAL BOUNDARY CONDITIONS ARE IDENTIFIABLE IN THE REGISTERS OF COGNITION AND PERCEPTUAL EXPERIENCE BRACKETED AS PATHOLOGICAL OR PARANORMAL, INCLUDING POSSESSION, SCHIZOPHRENIA, MESMERISM AND VOICE HEARING. ENTERTAINING THE HOMOLOGY BETWEEN DIFFERENTLY INSTANTIATED LOOPS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS IS IMPORTANT TO RECONCILING OURSELVES TO THE UNACKNOWLEDGED FACULTIES AND FUNCTIONS OF MIND MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY. THE PATTERN RECOGNITION LOOPS AT THE ROOT OF OUR PERCEPTION EVADE CONSCIOUS APPREHENSION – WE ARE NEVER AWARE OF THE FACT THAT SOME OF WHAT OUR EYES SEE IS PARTLY IMAGINARY. IT’S A DE-PRIVILEGING OF INDIVIDUAL VOLITION THAT MAY BE ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE TO EXISTING AND SURVIVING AS AN INTERPLANETARY SPECIES. IMPORTANTLY, THE CRITICAL DISCOURSES OF CULTURAL STUDIES, FEMINIST STUDIES, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY STUDIES (AND OTHERS WITH AFFINITIES TO THE ‘POSTHUMANITIES’) DIRECT OUR ATTENTION TO THE NON NEUTRAL PRODUCTION OF SYSTEMS – A FACT THAT COUNTERS THE ‘SINGLE ENGINEERING PARADIGM’ IDEA THAT THEY PROVIDE A PANACEA TO THE ILLS OF THE WORLD – AS ADVOCATES OF ALGO-REGULATED GOVERNANCE WOULD ADVANCE. WE CAN POSIT THAT THERE EXISTS LOOPS OF PATTERN DETECTION AND RESPONSE WHICH LIKEWISE EVADE OUR CONSCIOUS APPREHENSION AT MANY LEVELS – NEUROLOGICAL, TECHNOLOGICAL, SOCIETAL. THIS PATCHWORK OF NESTED LOOPS ARE STITCHED TOGETHER BY OUR BOUNDED SELF AND MAKE AN EVER PRESENT SENSE TO US BECAUSE WE POSSESS A STANDARDISED INDIVIDUATION. HERE AGAIN ENTERTAINING A NOTION OF PSYCHIC CONTINUUM IS USEFUL: THERE MAY BE NO MATERIAL LINK BETWEEN THESE DIGITAL LOOPS AND OUR NEURAL WETWARE, BUT THE FORMER CONSTITUTE THAT FROM WHICH OUR INDIVIDUATED SELF EMERGES. MIKE JAY,(JAY, THE REALITY SHOW) IN A DISCUSSION ON SCHIZOPHRENIC INFLUENCING MACHINES, NOTES THAT THE PSYCHOSIS OF A CENTURY AGO APPEARS REMARKABLY PRESCIENT RELATIVE TO OUR COEXISTENCE WITH TECHNOLOGY TODAY. “OUR WORLD IS NOW MEDIATED IN PART BY TECHNOLOGIES THAT FABRICATE IT AND PARTLY BY OUR OWN MINDS, WHOSE PATTERN RECOGNITION ROUTINES WORK CEASELESSLY TO STITCH DIGITAL ILLUSIONS INTO THE PRIVATE CINEMA OF OUR CONSCIOUSNESS.” THIS SOUNDS QUITE SIMILAR TO BRIAN ROTMAN’S EXAMINATION OF “SUBJECTIVITIES OPERATING IN ELECTRONICALLY PATTERNED INFRASTRUCTURE”.(ROTMAN, BECOMING BESIDE OURSELVES, 128.) ROTMAN IS ANOTHER AUTHOR WHO CONSIDERED HOW TECHNOLOGY COULD CHANGE OUR CONSCIOUS SELVES. OVER THE COURSE OF ‘BECOMING BESIDE OURSELVES’(ROTMAN, BECOMING BESIDE OURSELVES.) ROTMAN DRILLS INTO WHAT CODIFYING SPEECH, A CONTIGUOUS ANALOG EXPERIENCE, INTO DISCREET SYMBOLS ENTAILED.(LOGAN ALSO FOLLOWED A SIMILAR ENQUIRY IN ‘THE ALPHABET’) HE EXTRAPOLATES OUT THESE RAMIFICATIONS TO 21ST CENTURY DIGITAL MEDIA AND ITS CAPABILITIES OF MAKING MANY MORE REGISTERS OF CORPOREAL EXPERIENCE DISCRETE. HIS RESEARCH DRIVE IS IN THE SAME BALLPARK AS JAYNES AND SIMONDON. HE IS INTRIGUING TO OUR PURPOSES BECAUSE HE ARTICULATES WHAT A FUTURE INDIVIDUATION MIGHT RESEMBLE. FOR ROTMAN, IT IS A PARALLEL SELF – A HYPOTHETICAL FUTURE SUBJECTIVITY EMERGING ALONGSIDE PARALLEL COMPUTING: SOMETHING THAT HE BELIEVES WILL RADICALLY REORIENT OUR INTERNAL SELFS RELATION TO THE PRE-INDIVIDUAL FIELD EXTERIOR TO IT. ROTMAN CONSIDERS BODY-BRAIN HUMANS AS KINAESTHETIC, CORPOREAL, ENTITIES. AS SUCH THIS FUTURE ORIENTATION IS ENGAGING BODILY CAPACITIES WHICH ALREADY INHERE WITHIN US ALL – SAID CAPACITIES HAVE BEEN MERELY AWAITING THE APPROPRIATE ENSCONCING AFFORDANCES IN ORDER TO BE MADE MANIFEST. WE DON’T YET POSSESS THAT INDIVIDUATION, BUT ROTMAN DEEMS WE CAN DISCERN IT IN WHAT HE CALLS ‘”GHOST EFFECTS”’: MEDIA EFFECTS, TECHNOLOGICALLY INDUCED AGENCIES, EMERGENT EPIPHENOMENA OF MIND PLUS PRE-INDIVIDUAL TECHNOLOGIES. FOLLOWING ROTMAN’S EXHORTATIONS WE SHOULD SEEK AREAS WHERE ‘GHOST EFFECT’ HAUNTINGS MAY TRANSPIRE, SITES OF CONTESTATION WHICH PERHAPS FORESHADOW THE BREAKDOWN OF THE POST BICAMERAL MIND. THE DETECTION OF SUCH SITES CAN BE AIDED VIA THE WORK CONDUCTED ON ‘STACKS’ AND “STACKTIVISM’. IN SAID DISCOURSE, “‘THE STACK’ DESIGNATES “THE CHAIN OF INTERCONNECTED ACTIVITIES AND TECHNOLOGIES OF CURRENT AND HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE THAT SPREAD FAR BEYOND THE INDIVIDUAL”.(JAY, “ON HASTAG - STACKTIVISM.”) IT AFFORDS THE NECESSARY AGENCY TO TECHNOLOGY, AND RETAINS A CONCERN FOR THE SUBJECTS ENTANGLEMENT WITH INCREASINGLY UBIQUITOUS TECHNOLOGIES. IN THE STACK, SUBJECTS BECOME USERS, AS IN THE FIGURATION DEPLOYED BY BENJAMIN BRATTON.(BRATTON, “THE BLACK STACK - E-FLUX.” 40. IBID.) BRATTON LIKEWISE DEPLOYS THE LANGUAGE OF INDIVIDUATION, AND HIS LATEST PIECE ON THE BLACK STACK MAKES A CASE, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE “JUST-SO” STORIES ENTERTAINED THUS FAR, FOR SEVERAL CONDITIONS WHICH ONE MIGHT IDENTIFY AS CORRELATIVE TO THOSE THAT PRECIPITATED THE BICAMERAL BREAKDOWN MILENNIA AGO. BRATTON’S ACCOUNT OF THE BLACK STACK, A CONCEPTUAL EDIFICE YET-TO-COME (“NOT THE PLATFORM WE HAVE, BUT THE PLATFORM THAT MIGHT BE”), TREATS THE USER AS ONE OF SEVEN INFRASTRUCTURAL LAYERS. IN SO DOING BRATTON TEASES OUT THE NATURE OF EXISTING WITHIN VERTICAL STACKS AND TRADITIONAL NATION STATES (WHOSE HORIZONTALLY DELIMITED TERRITORIES OPERATE PERPENDICULAR TO THE STACK). FURTHERMORE, BRATTON IDENTIFIES THE GEOPOLITICAL COMPLEXITIES OF STACK EXISTENCE AS ENTAILING CRISIS FOR THOSE WHO INHABIT THE POSITION OF THE USER: “THE STACK (AND THE BLACK STACK) STAGE THE DEATH OF THE USER IN ONE SENSE: THEY DO SO BECAUSE THEY BRING THE MULTIPLICATION AND PROLIFERATION OF OTHER KINDS OF NONHUMAN USERS (INCLUDING SENSORS, FINANCIAL ALGORITHMS, AND ROBOTS FROM NANOMETRIC TO LANDSCAPE SCALE), ANY COMBINATION OF WHICH ONE MIGHT ENTER INTO A RELATIONSHIP WITH AS PART OF A COMPOSITE USER.” THESE COMPOSITE USERS, CONSTITUTING A DISPOSITION PERHAPS BETTER SUITED TO THRIVING IN THE TODAY’S TECHNO-SOCIAL LANDSCAPE, ECHO TECHNOLOGICAL AFFORDANCES PULLING FORTH THE BODIES LATENT PROCLIVITY TOWARDS PARALLELISM, JUST AS ROTMAN SPECULATED MIGHT HAPPEN. “THE POSITION OF THE USER THEN MAPS ONLY VERY INCOMPLETELY ONTO ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL BODY. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE PLATFORM, WHAT LOOKS LIKE ONE IS REALLY MANY, AND WHAT LOOKS LIKE MANY MAY ONLY BE ONE.”(IBID.) IN FRAMING IT THUSLY BRATTON RE-ARTICULATES THE PROBLEMATIC HOW DOES THE SUBJECT COPE WITH ‘LIVING SINGULARITY IN THE FACE OF MULTIPLICITY’. THE ‘LINEAR SELF’ INDIVIDUATION MADE PERFECT SENSE AGAINST A BACKDROP OF A PASSING EPOCH OF TECHNOLOGY (LANGUAGE-WRITING-MATHS). THIS TRIUMPH WAS REMARKABLE IN HOW IT SUPPRESSED CAPACITIES WITHIN THE HUMAN BRAIN-BODY-MIND SYSTEM THAT WERE AMENABLE TO NON-SEQUENTIAL MODES OF PARSING REALITY. THE QUESTION OF HOW DO WE MAINTAIN SINGULARITY IN THE FACE OF MULTIPLICITY IS INVERTED, BEGGING INSTEAD THE QUANDRY OF “WHY PERSIST IN ‘SEQUENTIAL-SELF’ INDIVIDUATION?” BRATTON CONSIDERS THAT “THE NEOLIBERAL SUBJECT POSITION MAKES ABSURD DEMANDS ON PEOPLE AS USERS... (AND) ELABORATE SCHIZOPHRENIAS ALREADY TAKE HOLD IN OUR EARLY NEGOTIATION OF THESE COMPOSITE USER POSITIONS.”(IBID.) THE POSITIVE SYMPTOMS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA, SURPLUS PROCESSES WHICH THE EXISTING COMMON INDIVIDUATION NEVER NEED BUFFER, PRESENT THEMSELVES AS COOKIE-CUTTER ALT-INDIVIDUATIONS WHICH SUDDENLY SEEM MORE APPROPRIATE TO OUR CURRENT CONTEXT – AS INDEED MIKE JAY’S ACCOUNT OF INFLUENCING MACHINES NOTED (ALBEIT SOMEWHAT TOUNGUE IN CHEEK). MOVING IN PARALLEL WITH JAY’S, BRATTON’S RIGOUROUS ANALYSIS SPINS OUT THE STAKES OF SEEKING ALTERNATE INDIVIDUATIONS INTO THE SHIFTING, CRISIS RIVEN, GEOPOLITICAL STAKES OF OUR TIMES – TUMULT THAT MAY USHER FORTH NEW INDIVIDUATIONS. MANY OF THE ISSUES AT STAKE IN BRATTON’S DISCOURSE ARE TOPICS TAKEN UP AND ENGAGED BY CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY ARTISTS, INCLUDING THE KEEN MINDS IN THE ORBIT OF STACKTIVISM. EVP AS PRAXIS, PROCESS OR METHODOLOGY, CAN INTERVENE IN THIS FIELD THROUGH ITS POWERFUL PHENOMENOLOGICAL LINK TO HISTORICAL ALTERNATE INDIVIDUATIONS – VOICE HEARING AND THE POSITED PRIOR REGISTER OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IT ONCE INSTILLED. IN IMMATERIAL BODIES: AFFECT, EMBODIMENT, MEDIATION LISA BLACKMAN INFERS THE PROCESSUAL COPING EVIDENT WITHIN THE HEARING VOICES NETWORK AS “AN EXPERIENCE OF THE SELF AS MORE DIVIDED AND DISTRIBUTED, OF THE ‘OTHER’ AS PART OF ME, AND OF LIVING WITH AUTOMATICITY AS PART OF THE SPECTRUM OF EXPERIENCE”. AUTOMATISM (PERHAPS BEST EVINCED IN THE STUDIES OF AUTOMATIC WRITING) IS ANOTHER CONCEPT THAT BLACKMAN EXCAVATES, AND IT INTIMATES ANOTHER ROUTE TO SEEKING SHADOW INDIVIDUATIONS RELEVANT TO FUTURE SUBJECTIVITIES. “A SENSE OF AUTOMATISM... EXPERIENCES WHERE A SUBJECT MIGHT FEEL THAT THEY ARE BEING DIRECTED OR GOVERNED BY AN IMPERCEPTIBLE FORCE OR AGENCY, OR EVEN BY A SECONDARY PERSONALITY.”(BLACKMAN, IMMATERIAL BODIES.) THAT SPEAKS TO THE SENSE OF BEING WEIGHED UPON BY OUR DATA DOUBLES, A GHOST EFFECT WELL SURFACED BY DATA ARTISTS (FOR INSTANCE, NETWORKED OPTIMISATION (NETWORKED OPTIMIZATION.) PROVIDES A POIGNANT INTERSECTION OF THE RECEDING AND ADVANCING TECHNOLOGICAL PARADIGMS DISCUSSED IN THIS ESSAY). SUCH DATA PERSONHOODS ARE DESCRIBED BY BRATTON AS “AN AGGREGATE PROFILE THAT BOTH IS AND IS NOT SPECIFIC TO ANY ONE ENTITY”. THE DATA EMISSIONS YOU INCUR THROUGH INTERACTING WITH DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS CAN DO WORK WHEN COMBINED IN AGGREGATE WITH OTHERS, INDEPENDENT OF YOUR VOLITION, BUT WITH LIKELY CONSEQUENCE FOR YOUR FUTURE DEGREES OF AGENCY OR ACTION.(BURROWS, “LIVING BY NUMBERS: METRICS, ALGORITHMS AND THE SOCIOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE.”) WITHIN THE PRE-INDIVIDUAL FIELD OF DIGITALLY PATTERNED SUBJECTIVITIES THERE ARE LIKELY MANY AUTOMATISMS WHICH WE DON’T ACKNOWLEDGE. SUCH AUTOMATISMS ARE PERHAPS ‘GHOST EFFECTS’ WHICH EVADE PERCEPTION BECAUSE THEIR BOUNDARY CONDITIONS HAVEN’T BEEN EXPLICITLY NAMED, PERHAPS CANNOT BE NAMED, EITHER BECAUSE THEIR DELIMITING FACTORS ARE PROPRIETARY STATISTICAL PROFILES, OR PRECISELY BECAUSE THEIR BOUNDARY CONDITIONS CARE NOT FOR DELIMITATION OF A BODY TO WHICH WE ARE ACCUSTOMED (SAY FOR INSTANCE, OUR ENCAPSULATING MEMBRANE OF SKIN). AUTOMATICITY DESCRIBES THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL ENCOUNTER WITH AUTOMATISMS. AS SUCH IS A VALUABLE METHODOLOGY TO DEPLOY IN UNDERSTANDING THE FRISION OF NASCENT SYSTEM SUBJECTIVITIES WHICH MAY RESULT FROM ALTERNATIVE INDIVIDUATIONS. INTEGRATED INFORMATION THEORY POSITS THAT “CONSCIOUSNESS IS THE WAY INFORMATION FEELS WHEN PROCESSED IN CERTAIN WAYS”. IF CONSCIOUSNESS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN INFORMATION IS BEING PROCESSED IN CERTAIN WAYS, WHAT THEN IS AUTOMATICITY? THE UNCONSCIOUS BRAIN IS STILL PROCESSING THAT INFORMATION, WE JUST DON’T ‘FEEL IT’. AUTOMATICITY DESIGNATES THE LIMINAL ENCOUNTERS WITH INFORMATION PROCESSING (OF WHICH WE ARE UNAWARE), TRANSPIRING AMONG THE DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS THAT COMPRISE ONES EXTENDED MIND. AUTOMATICITY AND EXTENDED MIND COULD BE FRUITFULLY COMBINED TO DESCRIBE THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL QUALITIES OF SYSTEMS SUBJECTIVITIES. WE MIGHT IMAGINE THOSE UNCANNY ENCOUNTERS WITH DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY & SYSTEMS, WHEN THEY ‘MOVE YOU’ WITHOUT YOUR WILLING IT TO BE SO, AS INSTANCES OF EXTENDED MIND AUTOMATISMS. THE AFOREMENTIONED DATA DOUBLES CONSTITUTE UNCONSCIOUS INFORMATION PROCESSING THAT AFFECTS OUR LIVED EXISTENCE, ALBEIT NOT TO THE SAME INTENSITY & INTEGRATION AS THE UNCONSCIOUS COMPUTATION PROCEEDING WITHIN OUR BODIES AND INSIDE OUR SKULLS. SHOULD SOME FUTURE ARRIVE WHERE THOSE DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS ARE SUFFICIENTLY INTEGRATED WITH OUR WETWARE THEN PERHAPS SOMETHING LIKE A BORG LIKE COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS WOULD BE ON THE CARDS. A MORE LIKELY ALTERNATIVE THAN THAT EXISTENTIAL BODY HORROR IS AN ACCOMMODATION OF THE ANTICIPATIVE INTELLIGENCE AND PREDICTIVE REGIMES OF GOOGLE AND OTHER LEADING MACHINE LEARNING VENDORS. SUCH A FUTURE ARRIVES WITH NO FANFARE – A BALLARDIAN SHRUG AT THE PROSPECT OF “DYNAMICALLY-PRICED QUEUES FOR CONFESSION-TAKING PRIESTS, AND THERAPISTS AND BRAIN CYCLES”.(LEVCHIN, “DLD13 KEYNOTE.”) AS THOSE FEEDBACK LOOPS CEASE TO BE ABJECT THEY ARE RENDERED LESS AMENABLE TO EXTENDED MIND AUTOMATISMS. WHAT HAS BEEN PRESENTED AND DISCUSSED IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT A NEOLIBERAL SUBJECTIVITY, OR SENSE OF SELF, PRESENTLY FINDS ITSELF AT ODDS WITH ITS SURROUNDING TECHNOLOGICAL MILIEUX, AND IT MUST ADAPT OR DIE LIKE THE BICAMERAL MIND BEFORE IT. AT TIMES THIS ESSAY HAS TAKEN TOO MUCH LIBERTY IN PRESUMING A HOMOGENEITY OF ‘SENSE OF SELF’ AMONG THE SUBJECTS OF ANY GIVEN POPULATION, NOT TO SPEAK OF THE DIVERSITY OF SENSES-OF-SELF DISTRIBUTED GLOBALLY. WHAT THE AUTHOR WOULD ASSERT WITHOUT CAVEATS IS THAT OUR SUBJECTIVE SELVES ARE COUPLED WITH, AND CO- CONSTITUTED BY, SYSTEMS. THESE ARE BOTH SYSTEMS THAT ARE RECOGNISABLY MECHANISTIC IN THEIR MATERIALITY – SUCH AS DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY - BUT ALSO FORMS OF ORGANISATION THAT HAVE GENERATED FROM SYSTEMS THINKING – LOGISTICS TO NAME BUT ONE EXAMPLE. THE STACKTIVISM DISCOURSE,(“STACKTIVISM.” HTTP:// STACKTIVISM. TUMBLR. COM/) CRITICAL ENGINEERING (“CRITICAL ENGINEERING.” HTTP:// CRITICAL ENGINEERING. ORG/) AND GREY MEDIA (FULLER AND GOFFEY, “ON THE USEFULNESS OF ANXIETY, TWO EVIL MEDIA STRATAGEMS.”) ARE USEFUL IN ELABORATING UPON THE LATTER. WITH THAT NOTED, PRESUMING A HOMOGENEITY OF A ‘SENSE OF SELF’ HAS BEEN NECESSARY, AS IF COMPUTING AND THE INTERNET ARE TO PROVIDE THE TECHNOLOGICAL TIPPING POINTS FOR AN INDIVIDUATION BETTER SUITED TO SURVIVAL AS A TRANSPLANETARY SPECIES, THEN THE EUROCENTRIC (HERE DESIGN ORIGIN OF BOTH TECHNOLOGIES (AND THE BUREAUCRATIC ORGANISATION THAT ACCRUED AROUND THEM) MERITS ACCOUNTING FOR AND A CRITICAL DISPOSITION. AUTOMATICITY, WITH ITS GENEALOGICAL LINKS TO THE PERIOD WHICH FIRST CAST THE MOULD OF THE ATTENTIVE SUBJECT, PROVIDES AN INTRIGUING ENTRY POINT FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO TRACE THE TOPOLOGY OF FUTURE EMBEDDED AND EMBODIED SYSTEM SUBJECTIVITIES.
