TO REGARD COGNITION AS ACHIEVING INDEPENDENT EXISTENCE OUTSIDE THE BRAIN, INHERENT IN THINGS IN GENERAL (OR IN FORM AS A PARTICULARITY) IS NOT A MYSTICAL OR MAGICAL FORMULATION. I HAVE BEEN WRESTLING WITH SOME NOTIONS OF THE POEM (FOR BOTH MY CRITICAL AND CREATIVE WORK) THAT EXPRESS AN UNPROVEN BELIEF IN THE COGNITIVE VALUE OF FORM; THIS CAN SEEM PRETTY INEFFABLE FROM THE MATERIALIST POINT OF VIEW I TAKE TO BE MINE. HOWEVER, COGNITION CAN BE CONCEIVED OF AS A VARIETY OF ‘MATERIAL ENGAGEMENT’ IN THE LIGHT OF A THEORY THAT TAKES THAT VERY NAME AS ITS OWN, AND MY DISCOVERY OF IT WAS FORTUITOUS. LAMBROS MALAFOURIS’ HOW THINGS SHAPE THE MIND (2013) CONTRASTS INTERNALIST VIEWS OF MIND, WHERE A CARTESIAN ENTITY COMPUTES AND CALIBRATES A WORLD IT CANNOT ENTER, WITH HIS OWN EXTERNALIST ONE THAT RECOGNISES ‘THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN COGNITION AND MATERIAL CULTURE’, (MALAFOURIS 2013: 17) THAT SEES THE MIND AS ENGAGING WITH, AND INTERACTING WITH, LEARNING FROM AND WITH, THE WORLD, ENTERING IT VIA MEANS OF WHAT HE CALLS ‘THE EXTENDED MIND’. (MALAFOURIS 2013: 17) HIS PRESENTATION AT FACT AS PART OF THE TORQUE SYMPOSIUM CLOSELY FOLLOWED THE ARGUMENT OF HIS NEW BOOK WHICH I OBTAINED AS SOON AS I WAS ABLE, KNOWING IMMEDIATELY THAT THIS WORK, WHICH STRUCK ME AS HAVING THE BRILLIANCE I RECALL FROM MY FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH PHENOMENOLOGY YEARS AGO, WOULD PROVIDE THE INSTRUMENTS OF THOUGHT (I USE THE PHRASE MINDFULLY) THAT I NEEDED FOR CRITICISM, POETRY AND POETICS. IN FACT ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE LAST TWO HAVE YET TO BE DRAWN. ‘FOR ACTIVE EXTERNALISM, MARKS MADE WITH A PEN ON PAPER ARE NOT AN ONGOING EXTERNAL RECORD OF THE CONTENTS OF MENTAL STATES’ – SUCH AS A POEM, OF COURSE – ‘THEY ARE AN EXTENSION OF THOSE STATES.’ (MALAFOURIS 2013: 74) AS MALAFOURIS WRITES, AND MAY WELL HAVE SAID THAT MORNING IN LIVERPOOL, ‘OUR WAYS OF THINKING ARE NOT MERELY CAUSALLY DEPENDENT UPON BUT CONSTITUTED BY EXTRACRANIAL BODILY PROCESSES AND MATERIAL ARTIFACTS.’ (MALAFOURIS 2013: 227) IN SHORT, AND IN JONATHAN KINGDOM’S DIFFERENTLY SPELT WORDS, HUMANS ARE ‘ARTEFACTS OF THEIR OWN ARTEFACTS’, AND SOME OF THOSE ARTEFACTS ARE THE ONES WE MAKE OUT OF LANGUAGE WHICH THEN MAKE US (A FACT ANY SERIOUS READER MUST KNOW INSTINCTIVELY). (MALAFOURIS 2013: 231) MALAFOURIS IS AN ARCHAEOLOGIST AND HIS EXAMPLES ARE PREHISTORIC AS WELL AS HISTORIC. ‘MARK-MAKING ACTION AND THINKING ARE THE SAME,’ HE REMARKS OF EARLY STONE INSCRIPTIONS WHICH, HE POINTS OUT WITH CARE, MAY NOT HAVE ORIGINALLY BEEN DEPICTIONS; THE MARKS AND LINES MAY ‘EXTERNALIZE NOTHING BUT THE VERY PROCESS OF EXTERNALIZATION’ WHICH WOULD DEVELOP INTO DEPICTIONS (OVER BREATHTAKING LENGTHS OF TIME). (MALAFOURIS 2013: 190) EVEN THEN, ‘THOSE EARLY PICTURES BRING FORTH A NEW PROCESS OF ACTING WITHIN THIS WORLD AND, AT THE SAME TIME, THINKING ABOUT IT’. (MALAFOURIS 2013: 203) THIS IS NOTHING LESS THAN A STORY ABOUT HOW WE BECAME HUMAN (AND HOW WE KNOW WE ARE HUMAN), THROUGH THE AGENCY OF THIS INTERPENETRATION OF MIND AND WORLD. NOTIONS OF THE POST-HUMAN (RATHER THAN POST-HUMANISM WHICH STRIKES ME AS A DIFFERENT ISSUE) ARE AFFECTED BY THESE NUANCED MEDITATIONS. ARGUMENTS FOR THE TRANSFORMATIVE FUNCTION OF CONTEMPORARY TECHNOLOGIES ARE BOTH SUPPORTED AND ATTENUATED BY THIS THEORY. MATERIAL ENGAGEMENT AFFECTS COGNITION, AS IN THE MODIFIED BRAINS OF HABITUAL MUSICIANS AND TAXI-DRIVERS CARRYING ‘THE KNOWLEDGE’ AND, WE MIGHT ASSUME BY ANALOGY, WRITERS, BUT IT DOES SO IN A WAY THAT IS AS OLD AS HUMANITY, FROM THE GREEKS TO THE GEEKS. SINCE THE MAKING OF THE FIRST STONE INSCRIPTIONS, MEN AND WOMEN – HOMO FABER – HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CYBORGS. BUT THINGS ARE ALSO MOBILE, THEIR AFFECTIVE STATES LARGELY UNRECOGNISED BY VARIOUS SOCIAL SCIENCES. ‘THE SENSUAL PROPERTIES OF THINGS AND THE AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE OF THINGS PERMEATE EVERY ASPECT OF OUR COGNITIVE ACTIVITIES AND PERMEATE OUR SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS.’ (MALAFOURIS 2013: 87) THE USES OF OBJECTS IN MOURNING, OR THE USES OF RELIGIOUS IKONS TO ACCESS ABSENT BEINGS OR TO CONCRETIZE ABSTRACT ENTITIES, ARE POWERFUL EXAMPLES. ARGUABLY A POEM MIGHT BE ONE OF THOSE SENSUAL AND AESTHETIC OBJECTS (EVEN AGENTS) AND ITS FORM – THE RESULT OF PARTICULAR FORMS AND OF ACTS OF FORMING – MIGHT BE THOUGHT OF IN THIS WAY AS A MATERIAL COGNITIVE ENTITY. AS A MAKER OF LITERARY ARTEFACTS I WONDER ABOUT THE POWER OF SUCH OBJECTS AND THE ANALOGY BETWEEN ANCIENT ARTEFACTS AND THE MODERN ARTIFICER. IN HIS 1978 ESSAY ‘REFLECTIONS ON A VIKING PROW’, CHRISTOPHER MIDDLETON OFFERS AN EXHILARATING DESCRIPTION OF THE CARVINGS ON THE PROW OF THE OSEBERG SHIP, TRACES THE WAY THE SPIRIT OF THE SEA, THE BOAT’S FICKLE MEDIUM, IS CARVED TRANSFORMATIVELY AS A DRAGON-LIKE FORM INTO THE WOOD, WHICH, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE, REMAINS VISIBLY WOODEN, FOREGROUNDING THE MEDIUM IN ITS PROTECTIVE ANIMISM. ‘THE SHIP WAS PROTECTED AND GUIDED BY MARINE PROTOFORMS,’ MIDDLETON NOTES, EMPHASISING THAT THE WORK WAS THEREBY FUNCTIONAL. THIS MATERIAL ENGAGEMENT HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE MAKER OF LITERARY WORKS. MIDDLETON CONCLUDES THAT, IN DISTINCTION TO THE AUTHORS OF ANECDOTAL POEMS WITH THEIR TENDENCY TO ‘LIMP, SELF-INDULGENT, AND HAPHAZARD WRITING,’ (MIDDLETON 1990: 287) ‘SUCH AN ARTIFICER’ – AND THE MODERN ARTIFICER POET HE LAUDS – ‘IS NOT CONFESSING, NOT FOREGROUNDING HIS OWN SUBJECTIVE COMPULSIONS, NOT CATALOGUING IMPRESSIONS, NOT HANGING AN EDICT FROM AN ANECDOTE.’ (MIDDLETON 1990: 283-4) THE ESSAY IS COMPLEX, ONE OF THE FINEST POETICS PIECES BY A CONTEMPORARY POET, BUT CONCLUDES (ALTHOUGH THESE WORDS ARE AT ITS BEGINNING) WITH A CONJECTURE THAT I, FOR ONE, WOULD WANT TO LIVE UP TO AS A MAKER OF THE COGNITIVE OBJECTS WE CALL POEMS. ‘SOME POEMS, AT LEAST, AND SOME TYPES OF POETIC LANGUAGE, CONSTITUTE STRUCTURES OF A SINGULARLY RADIANT KIND, WHERE “SELF-EXPRESSION” HAS UNDERGONE A PROFOUND CHANGE OF FUNCTION. WE EXPERIENCE THESE STRUCTURES, IF NOT AS REVELATIONS OF BEING, THEN AS APERTURES UPON BEING.’ (MIDDLETON 1990: 283) MALAFOURIS INSPECTS A POTTER AT WORK RATHER THAN PROWS, GREEKS RATHER THAN VIKINGS, BUT WITH SOME OF THE SAME IMPLICATIONS. ‘THE BEING OF THE POTTER,’ AS MALAFOURIS NICELY PUTS IT, ‘IS CO-DEPENDENT AND INTERWEAVED WITH THE BECOMING OF THE POT.’ (MALAFOURIS 2013: 212) THE COGNITION OF THE POTTER, AND EVEN HIS OR HER NEURAL PATHWAYS, ARE CHANGED BY THE COGNITIVE FUNCTION OF THE ARTEFACT. FORM IN A LITERARY WORK IS COGNITIVE THROUGH THE MECHANISM OF MATERIAL ENGAGEMENT, THROUGH THE APPREHENSION OF ACTUAL FORMS AND PERCEPTIBLE ACTS OF FORMING. AS HE SAYS OF VISUAL ART: ‘THE ARTIST’S SKETCHPAD ISN’T JUST A STORAGE VEHICLE FOR EXTERNALIZING PRE-EXISTING VISUAL IMAGES; IT IS A TIGHTLY COUPLED AND INTRINSIC PART OF ARTISTIC COGNITION ITSELF.’ (MALAFOURIS 2013: 237) THE WRITER’S PAGE OR SCREEN PRESENTS A SIMILAR THINKING- THROUGH THAT CHANGES THE POET AS WELL AS THE READER (THOUGH IN LYRIC FORMS THERE IS A CHANGE OF REGISTER THAT MAKES COGNITIVE LANGUAGE SING). TRIGGER WARNING AT A LOVE POEM THAT CAUSES YOU TO THINK WAR WITH JUST ABOUT ANYONE THE POEM BRISTLES WITH IMPLICATION AS YOU TOUCH ITS FORMS YOU FORM IT IN ACTS OF FORMING NOT TRICKS AND TRIGGERS UPON THE WALL OF COGNITION FOR THE FORMS KNOW A THING OR TWO AND NOT ONE MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU AS A VOICE SMEARS ACROSS THE SCREEN (FOR MY STUDENTS) THERE ARE SOME UNRESOLVED PROBLEMS WITH MALAFOURIS’ THEORY AND THEY EMERGE FROM HIS STUDY OF THE POESIS OF CONTEMPORARY POTTERS, WHERE ONE MIGHT HAVE IMAGINED THE THEORY WOULD FIND ITS TRUEST FIT. UNAWARE OF THE ‘DECISIONS’ MADE, THE POTTER NEVERTHELESS DECLARES THAT HE OR SHE MADE THE POT, AS I DECLARE, FAIRLY CONFIDENTLY, THAT I DRAFTED (THE POSSIBLY UNFINISHED) POEM ABOVE. THIS IS AN ‘AGENCY JUDGEMENT’ AND WHILE ARTIFICERS CAN CONCEIVE OF THE ACT AS ENACTIVE, SOMETHING HAPPENS TO US IN SUCH AN ACT AND WE NEVERTHELESS CLAIM AUTHORSHIP. (MALAFOURIS 2013: 218). ‘UNFORTUNATELY,’ LAMENTS LAMBROS MALAFOURIS, ‘ALTHOUGH A GOOD PHENOMENOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION CAN PULL US INSIDE THIS SEAMLESS FLOW OF ACTIVITY AND AGENCY,’ WHICH IS WHAT WE GET ACCOUNTS OF, WITH INCREASING INTENSITY, THROUGHOUT HIS BOOK, ‘WHEN WE CUT THE FLOW AND PRESS THE QUESTION OF AGENCY OUR INNER CARTESIAN SELF OR “INTERPRETER” WAKES UP TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE SITUATION.’ (MALAFOURIS 2013: 220) THE QUESTION OF AGENCY IN THE CASE OF A MAN PLUS A GUN (A CARTESIAN ‘GUN-MAN’) IS RAISED AND LEAVES A PERTURBING CONCLUSION: ‘ACTION INVOLVES A COALESCENCE OF HUMAN AND NON-HUMAN ELEMENTS, AND THUS RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACTION MUST BE SHARED AMONG THOSE ELEMENTS.’ (MALAFOURIS 2013: 221) IT IS ONE THING TO SAY THAT MY POEM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS OWN FORMING, EVEN AS I FORMED IT. THAT SEEMS SUNNILY SELF-ABROGATING. BUT IT IS QUITE ANOTHER TO SAY THAT THE GUN IS AS RESPONSIBLE AS THE MAN IN A BANK ROBBERY. IF MALAFOURIS IS TO ‘PUT BACK TOGETHER’ THE ACTIVE AND PASSIVE PARTS OF A CREATIVE ACT, ‘AND ACCOUNT FOR THEIR ONGOING AND IRREDUCIBLE CAUSAL COUPLING’ HE ADMITS, ‘IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER AGENCY CAN OFFER A WAY TO BRIDGE THE NEURAL AND CULTURAL CORRELATES OF OUR BODILY SELVES’. (MALAFOURIS 2013: 226) HE REMAINS INSPIRED BY A ‘VISION OF THE COGNITIVE LIFE OF THINGS’ WHICH INVOLVES ‘THE DISTRIBUTED AND COMPOSITIONALLY PLASTIC IMAGE OF THE POTTER SKILLFULLY ENGAGING THE CLAY’, RATHER THAN BY ‘THE LINEAR ARCHITECTURE OF A TURING MACHINE’, BUT ADMITS TO NOT HAVING FORGED THAT LINK IN HIS WORK SO FAR. (MALAFOURIS 2013: 238) THAT, OF COURSE, IS THE EXCITEMENT OF READING A THINKER IN THE ACT OF THINKING (PARTICULARLY WHEN THAT THINKER HAS A NOVEL THEORY OF THINKING!). IT POSES SOME QUESTIONS TO THE POET IN ME, AS REGARDS AGENCY IN CREATIVE ACTIVITY. I HAVE LONG SEEN CHOICE AND CHANCE AS ESSENTIALS IN A STOCHASTIC POESIS, SO HAVE LITTLE PROBLEM WITH SHARED AGENCY, BUT I ALSO FOLLOW DEREK ATTRIDGE IN BELIEVING THAT ‘AUTHOREDNESS’ IS SOMETHING WE ASSUME WHEN WE READ A LITERARY TEXT (AND THIS IS NOT AFFECTED BY THE POETICS OF APPROPRIATION IN CONCEPTUAL WRITING OR OTHER PRACTICES). (ATTRIDGE 2004: 136) THIS IS THE ‘AGENCY JUDGEMENT’ WE MAKE FROM THE OTHER SIDE. IF WE ASSUME, IN OUR APPREHENSION OF FORM IN ACTS OF FORMING, THAT THERE IS SOMEBODY THERE, MATERIAL ENGAGEMENT MAKES US AWARE THAT THERE IS SOMETHING THERE AS WELL, AND THAT THE THING AS WELL AS THE SOMEBODY (OR EVEN THE BODY) IS DOING (SOME OF) THE THINKING. ALTHOUGH ‘COGNITION HAS NO LOCATION’, PERHAPS ETHICS DOES; RESPONSIBILITY MUST LIE WITH THE HUMAN AGENT BECAUSE ONLY HE OR SHE CAN BE ANSWERABLE. (MALAFOURIS 2013: 85) PERHAPS THAT IS A SMALL ANSWER IN ITSELF TO QUESTIONS OF THE BRIDGE BETWEEN THE NEURAL AND CULTURAL. REFERENCES ATTRIDGE, DEREK. THE SINGULARITY OF LITERATURE.
