DESPITE HAVING PASSED A RECENT MILESTONE –1990-1999 BEING DUBBED ‘THE DECADE OF THE BRAIN’ – THE PHILOSOPHER CATHERINE MALABOU HAS NONETHELESS POSITED THAT WE STILL DO NOT KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO WITH OUR BRAINS (MALABOU, 2008). YET PHILOSOPHY IS PERHAPS CONFRONTING SUCH RISKS TOO LATE, AS AN ENTIRE TECHNICS OF SEARCH, QUERY, DATABASING, PATTERN MATCHING AND MACHINE LEARNING IS ALREADY ATTEMPTING TO DETERMINE WHAT OUR BRAINS MUST DO. SUCH A TECHNICS SEEKS OUT THAT SHARE OF MIND WHICH IS NONCONSCIOUS OR PRECOGNITIVE AND STAKES A CLAIM ON WHAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING AND FEELING, HOW WE SHOULD BE BEHAVING, BEFORE WE REGISTER THAT THIS ENTANGLEMENT IS SOMETHING WE MIGHT INDEED WANT. TAKE, FOR EXAMPLE, GOOGLE’S ASPIRATIONS BEYOND ITS CONSTITUTION AS THE ‘ULTIMATE’ SEARCH ENGINE. ITS CONSTRUCTION OF AND INVESTMENT IN ‘THE FUTURE’ RESTS ON ITS CAPACITY TO RETERRITORIALISE THIS PROTO- MIND SPACE. THIS RETERRITORIALISATION IS ATTEMPTED VIA A RAFT OF MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES FROM DATA MINING TO DATASET TRAINING, WHICH CLAIM TO REVEAL DIMENSIONS OF THOUGHT AND BEHAVIOUR. THIS MOVE AWAY FROM SEARCH PER SE TOWARD PREDICTION OF WHAT “USERS” DESIRE BEFORE THEY EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY WANT SIGNALS AN INSIDIOUS FORAY INTO THE NONCONSCIOUS AND AFFECTIVE TERRAIN OF PRECOGNITION AND ALL ITS INBETWEENNESS. NETWORKED PLATFORMS AND CORPORATIONS THUS TURN TOWARD SYSTEMS, TOOLS, AND PROCESSES OF WHAT I CALL “NEUROPERCEPTION”; THAT IS, A PARADIGM OF PERCEPTION THAT SEES HUMAN THOUGHT AND ACTION EMANATING FROM THE OVERLAY OF ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS ON TO OUR FORMING SENSORIUM. THIS OVERLAY STAKES A CLAIM TO WHAT ARE ACTUALLY THE INDETERMINATE NONPREDICTIVE CAPACITIES OF NEUROBIOLOGICAL PROCESSES. IN NEUROSCIENCE THIS NONPREDICTABILITY IS EVERYWHERE REFERRED TO AS THE BRAIN’S PLASTICITY. YET PLASTICITY IS NOT THE ONLY FACET OF BRAINS THAT MAKE THE NEUROSCIENCE OF THINKING INDETERMINATE: IF YOU TAP YOUR FINGER ON THE TABLE, YOU EXPERIENCE THE EVENT AS OCCURRING IN “REAL TIME”. THAT IS, YOU SUBJECTIVELY FEEL THE TOUCH OCCURRING AT THE SAME TIME YOUR FINGER MAKES CONTACT WITH THE TABLE. BUT OUR EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE STRONGLY SUPPORTS A SURPRISING FINDING THAT IS DIRECTLY COUNTER TO OUR OWN INTUITION AND FEELINGS: THE BRAIN NEEDS A RELATIVELY LONG PERIOD OF APPROPRIATE ACTIVATIONS, UP TO HALF A SECOND, TO ELICIT AWARENESS OF THE EVENT! YOUR CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE OR AWARENESS OF YOUR FINGER TOUCHING THE TABLE THUS APPEARS ONLY AFTER THE BRAIN ACTIVITIES HAVE BECOME ADEQUATE TO PRODUCE THE AWARENESS. (LIBET, 2004: 33) IN A RANGE OF EXPERIMENTS THAT BEGAN IN THE 1970S USING ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAMS TO MEASURE BRAIN ACTIVITY, BENJAMIN LIBET PROPOSED THAT THE BRAIN EXHIBITS A ‘READINESS POTENTIAL’ OF AT LEAST HALF A SECOND BEFORE CONSCIOUS AWARENESS THAT AN ACTION OR STIMULUS TAKES PLACE. THIS MEASUREMENT OF ‘EVOKED POTENTIAL’ IS A SHARP POSITIVE POTENTIAL APPEARING IN THE APPROPRIATE SENSORY REGION OF THE BRAIN ABOUT 25 MILLISECONDS AFTER A SKIN STIMULUS. LIBET’S EXPERIMENTS DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE IS AN AUTOMATIC SUBJECTIVE REFERRAL OF CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE BACKWARDS IN TIME TO THIS TIME MARKER. IN 2008, RESEARCHERS FROM THE MAX PLANCK INSTITUTE USED FMRIS TO WATCH IN VIVO BRAIN ACTIVITY OF PARTICIPANTS MAKING DECISIONS TO PUSH A BUTTON RANDOMLY IN EITHER THEIR LEFT OR RIGHT HANDS. THE FINDINGS WERE STARTLING, REVEALING THAT BRAIN ACTIVITY BEGAN IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE PREFRONTAL AND PARIETAL CORTEX – DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE FINAL DECISION WAS A LEFT OR RIGHT PUSH OUTCOME – UP TO 10 SECONDS BEFORE IT ENTERED AWARENESS FOR THE SUBJECT. THE RESEARCHERS CONCLUDED THAT THE DELAY PRESUMABLY REFLECTED THE OPERATION OF A NETWORK OF HIGH-LEVEL CONTROL AREAS THAT BEGAN TO PREPARE AN UPCOMING DECISION LONG BEFORE IT ENTERED AWARENESS. FORLIBET,THESESUBJECTIVEREFERRALSWOULDAPPEARTO BE PURELY A MENTAL FUNCTION WITH NO CORRESPONDING NEURAL BASIS IN THE BRAIN: [...] MY VIEW OF MENTAL SUBJECTIVE FUNCTION IS THAT IT IS AN EMERGENT PROPERTY OF APPROPRIATE BRAIN FUNCTIONS. THE CONSCIOUS MENTAL CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT THE BRAIN PROCESSES THAT GIVE RISE TO IT. HOWEVER, HAVING EMERGED FROM BRAIN ACTIVIATIES AS A UNIQUE ‘PROPERTY’ OF THAT PHYSICAL SYSTEM, THE MENTAL CAN EXHIBIT PHENOMENA NOT EVIDENT IN THE NEURAL BRAIN THAT PRODUCED IT (LIBET. 2004: 86–87) JOHN-DYLAN HAYNES, ONE OF THE 2008 RESEARCHERS SUGGESTS INSTEAD THAT THE ‘NEURAL PATTERNING’ AND AWARENESS OF A DECISION MIGHT BE MORE FRUITFULLY UNDERSTOOD AS BOTH A CONTINUUM AND IN RELATIONS OF FEEDBACK WITH EACH OTHER: IF WE FIND THAT A PERSON’S THOUGHTS ARE VERY CLOSELY ENCODED IN THEIR BRAIN ACTIVITY, WE CAN’T MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THESE THOUGHTS AND THE BRAIN ACTIVITY. WE DON’T NEED TO ASSUME THAT THEY’RE TWO SEPARATE ENTITIES EXISTING IN TWO DIFFERENT SPACES. (HAYNES, 2009) THE NOTION THAT NEURAL ACTIVITY ‘CONTROLS’ OR DETERMINES WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO IS A FANTASY DERIVED FROM OUR WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT THOUGHT AND THE BRAIN AND IS NOT NECESSARILY BORNE OUT BY THESE KIND OF NEUROSCIENTIFIC STUDIES. HOWEVER, PREDICTION IS GOOD FOR BUSINESS. A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE CONTEMPORARY “PREDICTIVE” TREND (AND AN ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE THE VAGUENESS OF ‘POTENTIAL’) IS THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF GOOGLE’S PREDICTION API TOOL. THIS TOOL FORMS PART OF THE NETWORKED CORPORATION’S SELF-CONSCIOUS DEVELOPMENT FROM “SEARCH” TOWARD ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MARRIES CLOUD COMPUTING WITH PREDICTIVE AI. BOTH PREDICTION API AND THE SHIFT TO PREDICTION AS THE ULTIMATE GOAL FOR GOOGLE SEARCH ARE INDICATIVE OF A DISPOSITION TOWARD CAPTURING AND RETERRITORIALIZING THE RADICAL POTENTIAL OF DISTRIBUTED (NEURO)ARCHITECTURES. LIKE ANY API, THE HEART OF THIS APPLICATION IS SOURCE CODE THAT ALLOWS FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF COMMUNICATION FUNCTIONS TO OCCUR ON OR BETWEEN COMPONENTS OF A DATABASE. IN THE CASE OF THE PREDICTION API, THESE FUNCTIONALITIES ALLOW FOR PATTERN MATCHING AND MACHINE LEARNING. AS ERIC SCMIDT, GOOGLE’S CEO FAMOUSLY STATED: I ACTUALLY THINK MOST PEOPLE DON’T WANT GOOGLE TO ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS... THEY WANT GOOGLE TO TELL THEM WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING NEXT. (SCHMIDT, E, 2010) WE CAN SEE THE MUTATION OF SEARCH INTO PREDICTION, CHANCE INTO DETERMINATION VIA STATEMENTS MADE BY GOOGLE SENIOR EXECUTIVES OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS: IN FIVE YEARS, GOOGLE WILL HAVE BUILT ‘THE PRODUCT I’VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BUILD - WE CALL IT ‘SERENDIPITY,’... [IT WILL] TELL ME WHAT I SHOULD BE TYPING.’ SCHMIDT IN FARBER: 2006) “SERENDIPITY” – WITHOUT THE LEAST AMOUNT OF IRONY – TRANSMUTES INTO “PREDICTION,” BECOMING THE RESOURCE ON WHICH THE GOOGLE MACHINE LAYS DOWN ITS ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS. TODAY THE MOST SERENDIPITOUS PRODUCT LEAVES NOTHING TO CHANCE. WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF GOOGLE’S GLASS. THE 2013 TED TALK IN WHICH SERGEY BRIN, GOOGLE FOUNDER, INFAMOUSLY FUMBLED BETWEEN HIS PHONE AND POCKET, ON THE ONE HAND, AND SMOOTHLY AND TRANSPARENTLY SLID FROM GLASS TO ITS TRANSDUCER BEHIND HIS EAR, ON THE OTHER, WAS REVEALING OF HIS ‘VISION’ FOR THE NEXT PHASE OF THE CORPORATION’S R&D. BRIN STATED THAT HIS VISION FOR GOOGLE WAS EVENTUALLY FOR ITS ENGINE TO BE “QUERYLESS” – INFORMATION WOULD JUST COME TO YOU WHEN YOU NEEDED IT. INDEED THERE WOULD BE NO ‘FUTURE’ – IN THE SENSE OF INDETERMINACY – FOR QUERY, BECAUSE THE POTENTIAL TO VARY, TO BE DIFFERENT AND, MOREOVER, TO CHANGE ONE’S MIND WHILE THINKING, WOULD NEVER BE ACTIVATED. INFORMATION WOULD JUST ARRIVE. WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT PLATFORMS SUCH AS GOOGLE GLASS, AND INDEED ANY PREDICTIVE TECHNOLOGIES, IS THAT THEY MODIFY THE TEMPORAL ORDERING OF IMMEDIATED ASSEMBLAGES OF TECHNOLOGY, BODY AND ENVIRONMENT INTO LINEAR SEQUENCES. IN SO DOING, THEY SHAPE THEIR ‘EVENTS’ INTO LINEAR ORDER; EVENTS HERE BEING SIMPLY THINGS THAT HAPPEN RELATIONALLY IN AND TO BODIES, BRAINS, TECHNICS AND THEIR HABITATS. THESE KIND OF TEMPORAL INFLECTIONS PERFORMED BY PREDICTIVE IMMEDIA ARE ‘CAPTURES’; THEY ARE POLITICAL BECAUSE THEY BRING FORCE TO BEAR ON RELATIONS OF PRESENTNESS, PASTNESS AND FUTURITY, AND BECAUSE SUCH FORCE HARNESSES US TO A SPECIFIC SUBJECTIVATION RELIANT UPON A PROPRIETARY PLATFORM. PREDICTIVE TECHNOLOGIES NECESSITATE AN UNFOLDING OF TEMPORALITY IN WHICH WE BECOME SUBJECTIVELY AWARE OF THE NEXT PRODUCT WE WANT TO BUY,THEN EXT ITEM WE REQUIRE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT, THE NEXT RESTAURANT WE WANT TO EAT AT, THROUGH A SIMULTANEOUS BACKWARD REFERRAL OR “ANTEDATING” OF OUR SENSORY EXPERIENCE AND A FILLING IN OF THE TEMPORAL GAP BETWEEN DESIRE (WHICH IS PAST)AND CONSCIOUSNESS (WHICH IS PRESENT) BY THE PLATFORM’S PREDICTIVE CAPABILITIES. PREDICTIVE IMMEDIATION ROLLS THIS GAP IN TO A PREDICATED FUTURE. THE EFFECT IS THAT ‘WE’ BECOME CONSCIOUS OF WHAT GOOGLE KNOWS WE ALREADY WILL DESIRE. GOOGLE’S GLASS BRINGS PREDICTION AND INFORMATION TOGETHER IN A SINGULAR CAPTURE OF IMMEDIATION – AND I MEAN IMMEDIATION RATHER THAN MEDIATION – SUCH THAT FUTURE THOUGHT IS MADE TO UNFOLD WITH CERTAINTY IN THE NOW. SUCH TECHNOLOGIES MUST BE THOUGHT OF AS NEW KINDS OF MEDIA, PERHAPS WE CAN CALL THESE POSTMEDIA INSOFAR AS WHAT IS AT STAKE IS A DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF THEIR TECHNICITY. TECHNOLOGIES OF TRANSMISSION AND BROADCAST – TELEVISION, RADIO AND TO AN EXTENT MUCH OF OUR PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE OF THE INTERNET AT OUR DESKTOPS AND SOME OF OUR PRIOR EXPERIENCE OF MOBILE INTERACTION – OPERATE BY MEDIATION. THIS IS MOST OFTEN ACHIEVED VIA THE HYPERMEDIATED FUNCTIONING OF SCREENS, SPEAKERS, HEADPHONES, TOUCHPADS AND SO ON. HOWEVER, TECHNOLOGIES AND PLATFORMS SUCH AS SMS MESSAGING, TOUCHSCREEN INTERFACES, IMMERSIVE ENVIRONMENTS, DIGITAL ASSISTANTS AND NOW THE FULL PLATFORM OF GOOGLE GLASS OFFER EXPERIENCES OF IMMEDIATION IN WHICH TECHNOLOGY, BODY AND ENVIRONMENT CO-MODULATE AT EVER FASTER SPEEDS. (IN FACT, IT COULD ALSO BE ARGUED THAT ANY MEDIATION IS ALWAYS ALREADY AN IMMEDIATION AT A MICRO-PERCEPTUAL LEVEL). WHAT IF WE WERE TO UNDERSTAND BRAIN- TECHNICS, TECHNICS-TEMPORALITY, EXPERIENCE- MEDIA AS ‘EVENTS’ RATHER THAN DETERMINATIONS OR OUTCOMES? IN WHAT WAY MIGHT A ‘READINESS POTENTIAL’ SUGGEST A NOVEL UNPREDICTABLE BECOMING OF THOUGHT? HOW MIGHT ‘BRAIN ACTIVITIES’ NOT BE ALIENATED FROM ‘THOUGHT’ BUT INSTEAD UNDERSTOOD AS NEURAL PROCESS THAT BECOMES INDIVIDUATED AS THINKING? “IMMEDIATION DOES NOT EXCLUDE DETERMINATIONS FROM THE PAST OR TENDINGS TOWARD THE FUTURE. THE TERM IMMEDIATION IS A WAY OF DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE EVENT AS THE PRIMARY UNIT OF THE REAL. THE IDEA IS THAT WHATEVER IS REAL MAKES ITSELF FELT IN SOME WAY, AND WHATEVER MAKES ITSELF FELT HAS DONE SO AS PART OF AN EVENT. IT HAS ENTERED IN SOME WAY INTO THE IMMEDIACY OF THE MOMENT AS A FACTOR IN THE EVENT NOW TAKING PLACE.” (MASSUMI IN BRUNNER, MASSUMI AND MANNING, 2013: 135) THE ACTUAL NONLINEARITY AND DESUBJECTIVATION OF NETWORKED, IMMEDIATE EVENTS IN WHICH SOMETHING MIGHT BE FELT OR SENSED BUT DOES NOT YET HAVE AN END POINT, DETERMINATION OR OUTCOME, CAN NOT BE TOLERATED BY PREDICTIVE TECHNIQUES. THE POLITICS OF CONTROL ENTERS WHEN PREDICTIVE TECHNIQUES INVADE AND ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE WHAT IS NECESSARILY INDETERMINATE AND YET NONETHELESS IS EXPERIENCED IMMEDIATELY – NONSENSUOUS, PRECOGNITIVE, PERCEPTION. WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL NOT TO IMBRICATE RECENT NEUROSCIENTIFIC FINDINGS WITHIN SUCH A POLITICS OF CONTROL, IN SPITE OF THE SOMETIMES MECHANISTIC AND REDUCTIVE MODES OF EXPLAINING WHAT IS ‘IN’ THE BRAIN. IF RECENT STUDIES SUGGEST THAT ‘THE BRAIN’ IS ALREADY PREPARING TO MAKE A DECISION BEFORE THAT DECISION IS CONSCIOUSLY KNOWN, THEN IT IS THE NOTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS ITSELF THAT NEEDS RETHINKING. WHAT IF CONSCIOUSNESS WERE INSTEAD AN IMMEDIATE ‘EVENT’ IN WHICH DETERMINATIONS FROM THE PAST AND TENDINGS TOWARD THE FUTURE BOTH MADE THEMSELVES FELT AS REAL? AND YET THE POTENTIAL TO DIFFER WERE ALWAYS, EVEN IF MICRO-NEURALLY, HELD ON TO AS REAL AS WELL? LOOKING ‘IN’ AT THE BRAIN VIA NEUROIMAGING TECHNIQUES WOULD THEN ONLY BE A REALIZATION OF THE BACKWARDS REFERRAL OF SENSORY EXPERIENCE; JUST ENVISIONED FROM THE MACHINIC PERSPECTIVE. FOR WHERE THE POTENTIAL TO DIFFER IS REAL, WHERE THIS POTENTIAL CAN ACTUALLY TRANSDUCE INTO SOMETHING NOVEL, WHERE POTENTIALITY AND NONLINEARITY CO-HABIT, PREDICTION ARRIVING BEFORE THE EVENT’S OCCURRENCE IS IMPOSSIBLE. THE INCREASINGLY MUTABLE MIXING AND MATCHING OF AUDIO, VISUAL IMAGES AND TEXT, ACCOMPANIED BY THE TACTILITY OF THE TOUCH SCREEN AND THE KINESTHESIA OF THE INTERFACE, QUITE ASIDE FROM ANY MORE INSIDIOUS PREDICTIVE TECHNICS, ALREADY CHANGES THE BODY’S PERCEPTUAL POSTURE, THE BRAIN’S ACTIVITIES AND REDISTRIBUTES THEIR ACTIONS IN RELATION TO THE INTERFACE, AS MUCH AS THE INTERFACE DISTRIBUTES INFORMATION. THESE CONSIDERATIONS CAN NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED EXTRANEOUS OR SECONDARY; THEY ARE NOT “MERELY” CONTEXTUAL. THEY ARE INEXTRICABLE FROM WHAT MEDIA DO TODAY. THE ISSUE IS NOT TO FIND A WAY TO RETHINK THE BRAIN IN TERMS OF LANGUAGES OF MEDIA OR TECHNICAL METAPHORS BUT TO BE BETTER ABLE TO UNDERSTAND MEDIA THEMSELVES AS ALREADY IMMEDIATELY ENTANGLED AND LIVED ASSEMBLAGES. MEDIA AND TECHNICS MIGHT BE BETTER THOUGHT OF AS MEDIA-EVENTS OR TECHNICAL-POTENTIALITIES; NOT AS OUTSIDE US BUT IN RELATION WITH US – A THINKING IMMEDIATED; A BRAIN-SCREEN (DELEUZE, 2000: 366); A TECHNICS-IN-MOTION. WE REQUIRE ECOLOGICAL APPROACHES FOR ARTICULATING THESE RELATIONALITIES.
