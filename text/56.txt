DESIRE- IMMEDIACY- COMPLEXITY- BEAUTY- ALL WORDS WE ASSOCIATE WITH PLEASURE, WITH DERIVING THE MOST INTENSE AND SUBLIME MARROW FROM THIS JUMBLED HOTCHPOTCH BAG OF EXPERIENCES WE CALL LIFE. IN THIS PRINT-SET ENTITLED “THE NEVER ENDING LINGUAL”, AT FIRST THE BODY SEEMS TO TAKE A BACK SEAT. IN THIS SMEAR OF THE CEREBRAL, GREY MATTER ECHOES ARE FLESHED OUT IN RELATION TO SCREEN SHAPES, UNIVERSAL SCREENS FROM WHICH MANY EXTRACT CONTEMPORIZED PLEASURE LOADINGS. JUST AS WE FETISHIZE THE SCREEN THROUGH THE USE OF PHONES, COMPUTERS, AND TABLETS, WE ALSO PLAY A GAME OF DESIRE-HIDE-AND-SEEK THROUGH THE ACTUAL CONNECTIONS WE MAINTAIN VIA THE USE OF THESE DEVICES. OUR BRAINS BECOME THE PLEASURE SITE FOR THE SOCIAL, A HUNTING GROUND FOR NEVER ENDING CONTACT, OF THE DESIRE TO REACH OUT AND ELECTRONICALLY “TOUCH”. AND ALL THE WHILE WE STRIVE TO STRENGTHEN THESE CONNECTIONS THROUGH REPEATED HITS OF REINFORCEMENT, OF TRICKLING AFFIRMATIONS FROM OTHERS. EACH “LIKE”, EACH STATUS RENEWAL, EACH COMMENT OR UPDATE WE SPAWN STRENGTHENS OUR DESIRE BASE: EXTENDED SYNAPTIC CONNECTIONS LIGHT UP OUR BRAINS LIKE ETERNAL FAIRY LIGHTS SOAKED IN A PHEROMONAL WASH OF CLICK AND PURGE, OF CREATION AND CONFIRMATION.
