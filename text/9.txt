I. “NEAR TO US ARE WHAT WE USUALLY CALL THINGS”, THE PHILOSOPHER MARTIN HEIDEGGER WRITES IN HIS FAMOUS ESSAY “DAS DING” (THE THING) (1975, 166). BUT WHAT DO WE MEAN WHEN WE SAY OF SOMETHING THAT IT IS A THING? WHAT THINGS ARE? HEIDEGGER TAKES THE EXAMPLE OF A JUG. I WILL USE INSTEAD A CERAMIC VASE THAT IS ‘NEAR TO ME’ AND THUS I HAPPEN TO KNOW BETTER (FIGURE 1). LET’S TRY TO THINK ABOUT ITS ‘THINGNESS’. WHAT MAKES THIS VASE A THING REALLY? ONE WAY WE COULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION AND COME TO KNOW THE ‘THINGNESS’ OF THAT VASE IS BY EXPERIENCING SOME OF ITS PHENOMENAL QUALITIES. WE COULD PERCEIVE ITS COLOUR, FOLLOW THE SHAPE OF ITS BODY, OR THE WAYS THE LIGHT IS REFLECTED ON ITS EXTERIOR SURFACE. IF WE WANT, WE COULD REACH AND GRASP IT. WE COULD FEEL ITS TEMPERATURE, WEIGHT, OR MAYBE – DEPENDING ON HOW EXPERIENCED WE ARE – ALSO SENSE SOMETHING OF THE TEXTURE AND PHYSICAL QUALITIES OF THE CLAY THAT IT IS MADE OF. ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT THE ‘THINGNESS’ OF THIS ARTEFACT IS TO TRY IDENTIFY ITS POSSIBLE FUNCTION. WE COULD, FOR INSTANCE, CLASSIFY IT AS A CONTAINER THAT CAN BE USED TO HOLD SOMETHING WITHIN IT AND NAME IT AS A VASE. WE COULD ALSO PERHAPS THINK ABOUT ITS ORIGIN, ABOUT THE PROCESSES RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING IT THE OBJECT IT IS. WE COULD THINK OF THE PEOPLE, THE ACTIONS, THE MATERIALS, THE TOOLS AND THE PLACES INVOLVED IN ITS MANUFACTURE, AND WE COULD ALSO THINK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF STYLE, TEXTURE, VALUE, AESTHETIC, SKILL, TIME OR TECHNIQUE. WE COULD ALSO TRY TO DRAW IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER. OF COURSE, THERE IS A PERSONAL OR SUBJECTIVE ELEMENT IN ALL THESE. I, FOR INSTANCE, JUST BY LOOKING AT THIS VASE CAN REMEMBER PERSONS, EVENTS, AND PLACES ASSOCIATED WITH IT IN THE PAST. THE VASE HAS A LIFE HISTORY OF WHICH I AM A PART. AS A RESULT, THIS OBJECT IS MINE IN A SENSE THAT IT CAN NEVER BE YOURS. BY THE SAME TOKEN THE VASE BELONGS TO THE POTTER WHO MADE IT – ON THE WHEEL–OR TO THE PERSON(S) WHO USE IT IN A WAY THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM MY REMOTE SENSE OF ‘MINENESS’. I CAN GO ON WRITING ABOUT THIS VASE FOR HOURS. BUT EVEN THEN WE WOULD HAVE MERELY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE OF THE VARIETIES OF OUR SENSUOUS MATERIAL ENGAGEMENT. BE THAT AS IT MAY, HAVE WE DONE ANY PROGRESS WITH OUR INITIAL QUERY ABOUT WHAT IS THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF WHAT WE CALL ‘THINGNESS’ OR ‘THINGHOOD’? NOT REALLY. IT SEEMS THAT THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN COMMON SENSE AND OUR USE OF LANGUAGE IN EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE MIGHT HAVE IT. HEIDEGGER, FOR INSTANCE, MAINTAINED THAT THINGS ARE NOT WHAT WE USUALLY CALL ‘OBJECTS’. THINGS BECOME ‘OBJECTS’ WHEN THEY LOSE THEIR ‘THINGNESS’. REFLECTING ON HOW A THING RETAINS OR LOSES ITS ‘THINGNESS’ HEIDEGGER COMES UP WITH THE FOLLOWING ARTICULATION: “THE VESSEL’S THINGNESS DOES NOT LIE AT ALL IN THE MATERIAL OF WHICH IT CONSISTS, BUT IN THE VOID THAT IT HOLDS” (HEIDEGGER 1975, 169). UNDERSTANDING ‘THINGNESS’ THEN IS LESS ABOUT PRODUCING A LIST OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY MATERIAL OR PHENOMENAL QUALITIES AND MORE ABOUT PENETRATING THE ONTOLOGICAL POWER OF THIS VESSEL TO “GATHER” SPACE AND TIME. BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SAY THAT A THING ‘GATHERS’? HEIDEGGER INTRODUCES THE TERM “THINGING” AS A MEANS OF EXPRESSING THE “GATHERING” OR TYING TOGETHER OF THE VESSEL’S ONTOLOGICAL CONSTITUENTS WHICH COMPRISE NOT JUST THE TOTALITY OF THE FORM-MAKING PROCESSES BROUGHT TOGETHER IN THE MAKING OF THIS PARTICULAR THING, BUT ALSO THE MATERIAL CONDITIONS AND RELATIONS THAT WILL SUSTAIN THE VESSEL’S SOCIAL, COGNITIVE, AND EMOTIONAL LIFE (ACTUAL AND POSSIBLE). THIS IDEA OF ‘THINGING’ AS ‘GATHERING’, I THINK PROVIDES AN INTERESTING METAPHOR TO THINK ABOUT THINGS. MY OWN USE OF THE TERM THINGING TRIES TO RETAIN SOMETHING OF THIS ORIGINAL SENSE OF ‘GATHERING’ AT ITS HEART. BUT I ALSO DIVERGE FROM THE HEIDEGGERIAN PHENOMENOLOGICAL PATH, ESPECIALLY RELEVANT TO ONE ASPECT OF ‘THINGNESS’ THAT IS TYPICALLY CAST IN THE SHADOW: THE VITALITY AND AGENCY OF THINGS IN HUMAN THINKING, OR ELSE, THE COGNITIVE LIFE OF THINGS (MALAFOURIS 2008C; MALAFOURIS & RENFREW 2010; BENNETT 2010; SUTTON 2002). I ARGUE THAT TO UNDERSTAND THE LATTER WE NEED FIRST TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHAT DO THINGS DO FOR THE MIND. TRYING TO DO SO, I ADOPT THE TERM THINGING TO DENOTE, MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE ACT OF THINKING AND FEELING WITH, THROUGH, AND ABOUT THINGS. THE NOTION OF THINGING WILL BE REFERRING TO THE PROCESS BY WHICH THINGS ARE PRESENTED TO US THROUGH ACTS OF MATERIAL ENGAGEMENT, RATHER THAN, TO THE PROCESS BY WHICH THINGS ARE RE-PRESENTED IN US BY WAY OF INTERNALISATION AND MENTAL SUBSTITUTION. IT FOLLOWS THAT WITH THINGING THE FOCUS FALLS ON A VARIETY OF MATERIAL ASSEMBLAGES (DELEUZE AND GUATTARI, 2004; MARCUS & SAKA 2006) AND ECOLOGIES (INGOLD 2012; HUTCHINS 2010) RATHER THAN JUST ON SPECIFIC OBJECTS, TOOLS AND EXTERNAL REPRESENTATIONS. THINGING EMBODIES CULTURE SPECIFIC BODILY TECHNIQUES, IT ALSO EXTENDS TO SENSORY AND COGNITIVE PROSTHESES AND INTERFACES OF ANY KIND. THIS DESCRIPTION OF THINGING IS PROBABLY TOO GENERAL TO SERVE TAXONOMIC PHILOSOPHICAL CONSIDERATIONS. BUT IN ITS LACK OF ANALYTIC PRECISION AND CLOSURE IT OPENS UP NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR TRANSGRESSING SOME OF OUR COMMON-SENSE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT MINDS AND THINGS ARE, AND ABOUT HOW THEY RELATE AND CONNECT TO EACH OTHER. THE ANALYTICAL VALUE OF THE NOTION THINGING, THEN, LIES IN HELPING US TO UNDERSTAND NOT WHAT THINGS ARE (AS ENTITIES), BUT INSTEAD, HOW THINGS COME TO BE, THAT IS, HOW THINGS COME TO POSSESS ONTOLOGICAL SPECIFICITY OR MULTIPLICITY IN THE COURSE OF THEIR LIFE HISTORY. THIS WILL INEVITABLY VARY IN DIFFERENT TIMES AND PLACES. THE NOTION OF THINGING SEEKS TO ENCAPSULATE THE MAJOR PHENOMENOLOGICAL INGREDIENTS OF THE LATTER PROCESS SHIFTING OUR ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE SPHERE OF ISOLATED AND FIXED CATEGORIES (OBJECTS, ARTEFACTS ETC.) TO THE SPHERE OF THE FLUID AND RELATIONAL TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE AND THINGS. IN DOING SO THINGING, ON THE ONE HAND, FREES THINKING FROM A COGNITIVIST VIEW OF WHAT MIND CONSISTS OF, AND ON THE OTHER FREES THINGS FROM A NARROWLY MODERNIST DEFINITION OF WHAT MATTER CONSISTS OF. THUS, SO FAR AS THINGING IS CONCERNED NO PRECISE AND CLOSED DEFINITION OF IT SHOULD BE EXPECTED. INSTEAD, I SUGGEST WE STRESS THIS ONTOLOGICAL MIXTURE OF MINDS AND THINGS AND WE WILL SEE HOW FAR IT GOES BEFORE IT TEARS. II IN ANY CASE, THE BASIC PREMISE THAT I WANT TO COMMUNICATE THROUGH THE NOTION OF THINGING IS QUITE SIMPLE: WE HUMANS ARE THINGERS. NOT ONLY MOST OF OUR THINKING IS THINKING WITH, THROUGH AND ABOUT THINGS, IT IS ALSO, AS HENRI-LOUIS BERGSON NEATLY PUTS IT MORE THAN A CENTURY AGO IN HIS CREATIVE EVOLUTION “A MANUFACTURING KIND OF THINKING” (UNE PENSÉE DE LA FABRICATION) (1998 [1911], 137). HUMANS ARE CREATORS OF NEW THINGS WHICH CONSTANTLY RE- SHAPE OUR BODIES, RE-CONFIGURE OUR MINDS, AND RE-INVENT OUR SELVES (CLARK 2007; MALAFOURIS 2008 A,B; 2010). NO OTHER ANIMAL HAS BEEN OR CAN BE DEFINED AS A SPECIES ON THE BASIS OF ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VARIETY OF THINGS AND MATERIAL FORMS THAT IT MAKES. WE HUMANS ARE PRECISELY A SPECIES OF THIS RATHER STRANGE SORT. BERGSON’S DESIGNATION OF MAN AS HOMO FABER RATHER THAN HOMO SAPIENS STILL CAPTURES AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THAT STRANGENESS. LET ME EXPLAIN, I SAY WE ARE STRANGE, NOT BECAUSE I DENY THAT OTHER ANIMALS ARE CAPABLE OF THINGING - WE KNOW THAT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THEY ARE. NOR DO I SAY WE ARE STRANGE BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT BY MAKING THINGS, AND BY THINKING THROUGH THINGS WE OVERCOME THE LIMITS OF OUR ‘NATURE’ AND ENTER INTO A SEPARATE ‘CULTURAL’ REALM. THERE IS NO MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF HUMAN EVOLUTION WHERE BIOLOGY GAVE WAY TO CULTURE. SUCH A SEPARATION BETWEEN ‘NATURE’ AND ‘CULTURE’ WOULD CONTRADICT THE REALITY OF BECOMING AS A RECIPROCAL BELONGING AND MINGLING OF THE TWO IN THE PROCESS OF HUMAN EVOLUTION (SEE ALSO INGOLD & PÁLSSON 2013; INGOLD 2004; BLOCH 2012). INSTEAD, HUMAN BECOMING HAS ALWAYS BEEN INSEPARABLY LINKED WITH THE DEVELOPMENTAL CONTINGENCIES OF ACTION. NO BODILY ACTIVITY - NOT EVEN OUR BASIC CAPACITY FOR BIPEDAL LOCOMOTION - IS IMMUNE TO THE SITUATED DYNAMICS OF REAL LIFE ONTOGENETIC DEVELOPMENT. AS THE ANTHROPOLOGIST MARCEL MAUSS NEATLY POINTS OUT IN HIS FAMOUS ESSAY ON BODILY TECHNIQUES, THERE IS NO ‘NATURAL’ WAY TO MOVE OUR BODIES (1973). I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THERE IS NO ‘CULTURAL’ WAY EITHER. INSTEAD, WE SHOULD THINK OF THE ACTING BODY AS A RELATIONAL DEVELOPMENTAL ACHIEVEMENT OF SITUATED MATERIAL ENGAGEMENT. THIS OPENING UP OF THE CONDITIONS AND POSSIBILITIES OF HUMAN BECOMING BY WAY OF MATERIAL ENGAGEMENT BRINGS US RIGHT AT THE HEART OF THE PHENOMENON I AM TRYING TO CAPTURE WHEN I TALK ABOUT HUMAN STRANGENESS: WE HUMANS HAVE MADE THINGING PART OF OUR NATURE. PUTTING IT SIMPLY, WITH THINGING BIOLOGICAL HEREDITY BECOMES CREATIVE EVOLUTION. INSTEAD OF SIMPLY REPRODUCING OURSELVES, WE RATHER EXTEND OURSELVES AND WE CONSTRUCT NEW COGNITIVE AND MATERIAL ECOLOGIES FOR GROWING AND INSTITUTING OUR MINDS. WE CREATE THINGS WHICH IN TURN CREATE US. AS I WILL RETURN TO DISCUSS IN THE LAST PART OF THE ESSAY THE ONTOLOGICAL MESSINESS OF THIS ONGOING DIALECTIC OF CO-CONSTITUTION CAN BE THE CAUSE OF COGNITIVE DISSONANCE AND EPISTEMIC EMBARRASSMENT, BUT ALSO THE SOURCE OF INSPIRATION. SO WHAT EXACTLY DO WE MEAN WHEN WE SAY THAT THINGS MAKE US JUST AS MUCH AS WE MAKE THINGS? THIS QUESTION RAISES A GREAT CHALLENGE FOR ALL THE DISCIPLINES INVOLVED IN THE STUDY OF HUMAN WAYS OF BEING AND BECOMING – ESPECIALLY FOR ARCHAEOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY. WHAT WOULD MAKE A GOOD EXAMPLE TO ILLUSTRATE THE IMPACT OF THINGING IN HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS? GIVEN THAT ONE OF THE LEADING QUESTIONS OF THE TORQUE SYMPOSIUM, FROM WHICH THIS ESSAY DERIVES, WAS ABOUT THE WAYS NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE ‘TWISTING TOGETHER’ MOMENTS OF READING, WRITING AND SPEAKING, I WILL USE THE PRACTICE OF WRITING AS A FORM OF THINGING. III. WHAT IS THE TRANSFORMATIVE IMPACT OF WRITING IN HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS, SELF CONCEPTION, AND THINKING? FROM THEUTH’S INVENTION OF WRITING IN PLATO’S PHAEDRUS TO GOOGLE THE QUESTION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WRITING AND THINKING REMAINS OPEN. ACCORDING TO THE SO-CALLED “LITERACY THESIS” THE ADVENT OF WRITING HAS CHANGED THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT LANGUAGE (GOODY 1968; MCLUHAN 1964; ONG 1982; HARRIS 1989). THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEA IS SIMPLE: WRITING INVITES REFLECTIVE AND CRITICAL THINKING. ONCE SOMETHING IS WRITTEN IT AFFORDS AND MOTIVATES COMPARISON, QUESTIONING AND INTERPRETATION – EVEN SKEPTICISM - IN WAYS THAT THE TRANSIENT AND CONTEXT-DEPENDENT ORAL FORMS OF NARRATION AND COMMUNICATION DO NOT. “WITHOUT WRITING”, WALTER ONG FAMOUSLY ARGUED (1982, 78) THE MIND “WOULD NOT AND COULD NOT THINK AS IT DOES”. OF COURSE, TO SAY THAT WRITING CHANGES THE WAY WE THINK DOES NOT NEED TO IMPLY ANY SIMPLISTIC DICHOTOMY BETWEEN LITERATE AND NON-LITERATE SOCIETIES. FOR ONE THING, THERE IS NO CLEAR SENSE IN WHICH READING AND WRITING CONSTITUTE AN ADVANCE ON ITS PREDECESSORS’ MENTAL POWERS. FOR ANOTHER, THE EFFECTS OF LITERACY CANNOT BE SEPARATED OR UNDERSTOOD INDEPENDENTLY OF THEIR BROADER HISTORICAL SITUATION, LEARNING ENVIRONMENT, AND SKILLS. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES ARE TO BE EXPECTED BUT THOSE CHANGES ARE THE RELATIONAL PRODUCTS OF SPECIFIC COGNITIVE ECOLOGIES OF LITERACY RATHER THAN LITERACY AS SUCH (SEE E.G. SCRIBNER AND COLE 1981). AS SYLVIA SCRIBNER REMINDS US “THE SINGLE MOST COMPELLING FACT ABOUT LITERACY IS THAT IT IS A SOCIAL ACHIEVEMENT... LITERACY ABILITIES ARE ACQUIRED BY INDIVIDUALS ONLY IN THE COURSE OF PARTICIPATION IN SOCIALLY ORGANIZED ACTIVITIES WITH WRITTEN LANGUAGE” (1984, 7-8). NEVERTHELESS, THERE IS A NEW KIND OF CONSCIOUSNESS EMERGING WITHIN THIS PROCESS OF WRITING. WRITING MORE THAN THE PASSIVE EXTERNALIZATION OF SPEECH BY WAY OF SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATIONS IS A RADICAL TRANSFORMATION IN THE PERCEPTUAL EXPERIENCE AND THUS AWARENESS OF LANGUAGE. TO PERCEIVE SPEECH AS A LINEAR SEQUENCE OF WORDS, SYMBOLS, AND SENTENCES OPENS THE DOOR TO A NEW AWARENESS AND MEANING OF SIGNIFICATION. MEANWHILE, RECENT DISCOVERIES IN COGNITIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE DEMONSTRATE HOW THE BRAIN IS CHANGED BY LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE (DEHAENE 2009). WHAT IS LESS OBVIOUS IS HOW WE ACCOUNT AND INTERPRET THOSE CHANGES, AS WELL AS HOW THOSE CHANGES DIFFER FROM OTHER CHANGES THAT OCCUR AS A RESULT OF CULTURAL INVENTION AND PRACTICE. DAVID OLSON OFFERS A COMPELLING EXAMPLE OF THIS EXPLORATION INTO THE COGNITIVE IMPLICATIONS OF READING AND WRITING IN THE LAST TWO CHAPTERS OF HIS BOOK THE WORLD ON PAPER (1994) WHEN HE DESCRIBES THE ORIGINS OF SUBJECTIVITY AND THE MAKING OF THE LITERATE MIND. DIFFERENTIATING HIS VIEW ON THE COGNITIVE IMPLICATIONS OF WRITING FROM MERLIN DONALD’S EMPHASIS ON THE USE OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF “EXOGRAPHIC STORAGE” (1991) AS A MEANS OF COGNITIVE EXTENSION HE ARGUES THAT MORE THAN EXTENDING MEMORY THE PRIMARY IMPACT OF THOSE GRAPHIC PRACTICES SHOULD BE SOUGHT IN “THE NEW CONCEPTS” EMERGING FROM THEIR USE. IT IS THOSE CONCEPTS WHICH EFFECT THE GREATEST CHANGE IN OUR WAYS OF THINKING BY ALLOWING US TO UNDERSTAND LANGUAGE, THE WORLD AND OUR MINDS IN A NEW WAY (1994, 258). MORE RECENTLY, THE PHILOSOPHER RICHARD MENARY, WORKING ON THE SAME QUESTION OF HOW WRITING CHANGES THE WAY PEOPLE THINK AND ACT OUTLINES WHAT HE CALLS “A COGNITIVE INTEGRATIONIST ACCOUNT” (2007, 621-22). IN BRIEF, MENARY VIEWS WRITING AS A HYBRID MENTAL ACT THAT INVOLVES THE CO-ORDINATED INTERACTION BETWEEN DIFFERENT PROCESSES (NEURAL, BODILY AND ENVIRONMENTAL). THE BASIC POINT OF MENARY’S THESIS IS THAT BOTH WRITING AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE ENDURING PRODUCTS OF THIS PROCESS CAN BE MANIPULATED, SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD AS AN ACTIVE PROCESS OF ‘THINKING IN ACTION’. I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH MENARY’S COGNITIVE INTEGRATIONIST MODEL OF WRITING, BUT I SUGGEST IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO SPECIFY HOW DIFFERENT ACTS OF WRITING AND THEIR PRODUCTS (WRITTEN SENTENCES OR OTHER) DIFFER FROM ONE SOCIO- HISTORICAL CONTEXT TO THE OTHER. THIS MEANS THAT WRITING LETTERS ON THE PAGE OR IN ANY OTHER AVAILABLE MEDIUM, MUST BE UNDERSTOOD NOT ONLY AS WAYS OF ACTING AND THINKING BUT ALSO AS INSEPARABLE PARTS OF LITERACY PRACTICES AND TECHNIQUES WHICH, AS HAS BEEN SHOWN BY SCRIBNER AND COLE (1981) IN THEIR FAMOUS METICULOUS STUDY OF THE VAI PEOPLE OF WEST AFRICA (LIBERIA AND SIERRE LEONE), ARE PRODUCTS OF GIVEN SOCIETY AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT. IN OTHER WORDS, WE NEED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE CONTEXT- DEPENDENT NATURE OF READING AND WRITING SKILLS AS FORMS OF THINGING. THAT IS, WE NEED A COMPARATIVE ANTHROPOLOGY OF WRITING, ONE THAT IS MATERIALLY AND PRACTICE ORIENTED, BUT ALSO FIRMLY GROUNDED IN AN IMAGE OF MIND NOT LIMITED BY THE SKIN. ONLY THEN WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCES OR SIMILARITIES BETWEEN A MEDIEVAL CLERIC AND A MYCENAEAN SCRIBE, OR BETWEEN THE TRACE OF AN INSCRIPTION LEFT BY THE HAND ON THE PAGE AND THE TYPING ON PRESENT DAY QWERTY KEYBOARDS. UNDERSTANDING IMPORTANT TRANSITIONS IN THE HISTORY OF HUMAN GRAPHIC SYSTEMS, FROM THE MEDIEVAL MANUSCRIPT TO THE MODERN PRINTED TEXT TO THE INTERNET, DEPEND ON CRITICALLY UNDERSTANDING THE COGNITIVE ECOLOGIES AND ONTOLOGIES OF THE MATERIALITIES AND BODILY PRACTICES INVOLVED. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN REALLY? LET’S TAKE ONE STEP AT A TIME. I RETURN TO THE BASICS. EXACTLY HOW ARE THINGS RELATED TO THINKING? IV CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RELATED PHILOSOPHICAL QUERY: WHERE DOES THE MIND STOP AND THE REST OF THE WORLD BEGIN? I WOULD SAY THAT THIS INCREASINGLY POPULAR QUESTION, RAISED INITIALLY BY THE PHILOSOPHERS ANDY CLARK AND DAVID CHALMERS IN THEIR FAMOUS ESSAY THE EXTENDED MIND (1998), STILL SOUNDS ODD TO MANY PEOPLE. SURELY THE HUMAN HEAD OFFERS A ‘NATURAL’ DEMARCATION LINE FOR SEPARATING MIND-STUFF FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD. WHY DO WE NEED OUR BIG AND METABOLICALLY EXPENSIVE BRAINS IF NOT FOR TAKING CARE OUR THINKING? CAN THIS DEEPLY ENTRENCHED ASSUMPTION ABOUT THE BOUNDARIES OF THE MIND BE WRONG? MANY PEOPLE WORKING IN THE SCIENCES OF THE MIND FROM A DYNAMICALLY BASED EMBODIED, DISTRIBUTED AND ENACTIVE PERSPECTIVE THINK THAT IT IS (VARELA ET AL. 1991; CLARK 1997; 2008; HUTCHINS 1995; 2010; THOMPSON 2007; HUTTO & MYIN 2013; CHEMERO 2009; WHEELER 2005; NOË 2004; SUTTON 2008; MENARY 2010). I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THEM. BUT HOW CAN THIS BE? IT IS ONE THING TO SAY THAT ONE CAN BE WRONG ABOUT WHAT PART OF THE BRAIN CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT KIND OF MENTAL ACTIVITY, OR TO DISAGREE ABOUT THE BIOLOGICAL AND EVOLUTIONARY BASIS AND FUNCTION OF THESE ASSOCIATIONS, IT IS INDEED, ANOTHER TO SAY THAT MOST OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE HUMAN MIND IS GROUNDED ON SUCH A HUGE ONTOLOGICAL MISTAKE. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT A LONG-STANDING TRADITION IN WESTERN PHILOSOPHY, PSYCHOLOGY AND MORE RECENTLY COGNITIVE SCIENCE WOULD HAVE REPEATEDLY FAILED TO REALISE, SUCH AN OBVIOUS FACT OF HUMAN COGNITIVE LIFE, NAMELY, THAT HUMAN THOUGHT IS NOT MERELY EXPRESSED IN THINGS BUT, INSTEAD, IT COMES INTO EXISTENCE THROUGH THEM? THERE ARE MANY REASONS AND, OBVIOUSLY, I CANNOT DISCUSS THEM HERE AT ANY LENGTH. I WILL JUST MENTION THE ONE MORE PERTINENT TO MY PURPOSE HERE AND MORE RELEVANT TO MY PURPOSE IN THIS ESSAY. MOST OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE HUMAN MIND, BUT ALSO THE WAYS BY WHICH WE HAVE COME TO KNOW WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE HUMAN MIND, CAME ABOUT WITHOUT ANY CONSIDERATION TO THE WORLD OF THINGS. THE MIND CAN BE AWARE OF THINGS, OR PERCEIVE THINGS, BUT THE MENTAL ACTIONS WHICH ENABLE US TO THINK ABOUT THINGS ARE SEEN AS DIFFERENT IN KIND FROM THE PHYSICAL ACTIONS WE USE TO GRASP AND MANIPULATE THEM. PHILOSOPHERS MAY HAVE PONDERED FOR CENTURIES IF THINGS EXIST WHETHER OR NOT AN ORGANISM PERCEIVES OR IS AWARE OF THEM, BUT THE NATURE OF THIS AWARENESS WAS NEVER PREMISED IN THE PRESENCE OF THINGS, BUT ALWAYS IN THEIR ABSENCE. PARADOXICALLY, ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN MUCH DEBATE AND DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER THERE CAN BE THOUGHT WITHOUT LANGUAGE, THE POSSIBILITY OF THE CO-CONSTITUTION OF MINDS AND THINGS, THAT IS, OF THINKING AS THINGING HAS NEVER BEEN PROPERLY EXPLORED OR EVEN RAISED. THOUGH THIS EPISTEMIC NEGLECT OF THINGS IS UNFORTUNATE, IT IS HARDLY SURPRISING. ONE OF THE MAJOR OBJECTIVES IN THE STUDY OF MIND HAS BEEN TO DEMARCATE AND INSULATE THE MENTAL FROM THE PHYSICAL AND THEN COME UP WITH A MECHANISM ABLE TO BRIDGE THE HUGE ONTOLOGICAL GAP LEFT BETWEEN. TO ACCOMPLISH THAT MATERIAL CULTURE HAS TO BE LEFT OUT FROM THE COGNITIVE SYSTEM PROPER. IN THE PLACE OF REAL THINGS ‘OUT THERE’ VARIOUS NEURAL AND MENTAL SUBSTITUTES WERE CREATED AND PLACED INSIDE THE CRANIUM. WE CALL THOSE SUBSTITUTES MENTAL, OR MORE RECENTLY, NEURAL ‘REPRESENTATIONS’. I IMAGINE THAT METHODOLOGICALLY SPEAKING, THIS SUBSTITUTION MAKES GOOD SENSE IF YOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIT A PART OF THE WORLD INSIDE THE BRAIN WHILE LYING STILL IN A FMRI SCANNER OR TO BUILD A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL TO ACCOUNT FOR IT. BUT THE ONTOLOGY OF THIS UNDERLYING REPRESENTATIONAL LOGIC IS WEAK AND ITS PRODUCTS OFTEN RESEMBLE A LIFELESS ABSTRACTION. MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT MISLEADS US TO THINK THAT ALL THAT REALLY MATTERS TO STUDY THE MIND AND ITS EVOLUTION IS TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THE INTERNAL MENTAL REPRESENTATIONS AND THE INPUT/OUTPUT MECHANISMS THAT ENABLE THEIR FORMATION, TRANSFORMATION AND PROCESSING. AS A RESULT, NOT ONLY DOES IT OFTEN GO UNNOTICED THAT MOST OF OUR THINKING TAKES PLACE OUTSIDE OUR HEADS, BUT WHEN IT GETS NOTICED IT SEEMS ODD. MUCH OF VALUE IN THE STUDY OF MIND HAS BEEN LOST. FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF ARCHAEOLOGY, LOOKING CAREFULLY AT THE EARLIEST EXAMPLES OF HUMAN ENGAGEMENT WITH THE MATERIAL WORLD ONE COULD HARDLY FIND ANY REASON WHY THE STUDY OF THE MIND SHOULD SIMPLY FOCUS ON THE BRAIN ‘INSIDE’ THE HEAD. RATHER, WHAT WE SEE IN THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD SUGGESTS BOTH EQUIVALENCE AND COMPLEMENTARITY OF WHAT IS ‘INSIDE’ WITH WHAT IS ‘OUTSIDE’. FROM THE COEVOLUTION OF STONE TOOLS AND LANGUAGE AND THE FREEING OF HANDS TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE FIRST COMPOUND TOOLS, BODY ORNAMENTS, ENGRAVINGS, TO THE EMERGENCE OF SYMBOLS AND WRITING SYSTEMS, THINGING HAS BEEN PLAYING AN ACTIVE ROLE IN HUMAN EVOLUTION EXTENDING OUR BODIES AND BRINGING FORTH OUR MINDS. THERE IS AN ABUNDANCE OF EVIDENCE TESTIFYING THAT THINGS, LIKE NEURONS, HAVE PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE MAKING OF THE HUMAN MIND. BRAINS, BODIES AND THINGS PARTICIPATE EQUALLY, ALBEIT IN DIFFERENT WAYS, IN HUMAN COGNITIVE LIFE. OBVIOUSLY, I DO NOT MEAN TO QUESTION THE NEURAL BASES OF COGNITION OR THE IMMENSE CONTRIBUTION OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS LIKE NEUROIMAGING IN DELINEATING HOW COGNITION IS SUPPORTED AND MEDIATED BY THE BRAIN. I WANT SIMPLY TO UNDERLINE THAT THE BRAIN IS ONLY PART OF THE STORY OF MIND, OR TO USE THE WORDS OF PRAGMATIST PHILOSOPHER AND PSYCHOLOGIST JOHN DEWEY “HANDS AND FEET, APPARATUS AND APPLIANCES OF ALL KINDS ARE AS MUCH A PART OF IT AS CHANGES WITHIN THE BRAIN” (DEWEY 1916, 13–14). THIS IS ALSO WHERE MATERIAL ENGAGEMENT THEORY (MET) COMES IN (MALAFOURIS 2013; 2004). THE MAJOR OBJECTIVES ARE: (A) TO EXPLORE THE VARIETIES OF HUMAN HINGING, AND (B) TO INVESTIGATE HOW THOSE WAYS MIGHT HAVE CHANGED SINCE EARLIEST PREHISTORY, AND WHAT IMPLICATIONS THEY MAY HAVE FOR HUMAN INTELLIGENCE. MATERIAL ENGAGEMENT THEORY WANTS TO CHANGE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT MINDS ARE, AND WHAT MINDS ARE MADE OF, BY CHANGING WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT THINGS ARE AND ABOUT WHAT THINGS DO FOR THE MIND. IT ENABLES US TO RESTATE THE PROBLEM OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN COGNITION AND MATERIAL CULTURE BY PLACING IT UPON A NEW RELATIONAL FOUNDATION. THE ANTHROPOLOGIST EDWIN HUTCHINS (2010), ALSO INSPIRED BY GREGORY BATESON, USES THE TERM COGNITIVE ECOLOGY TO DESCRIBE A SIMILAR KIND OF RELATEDNESS. THE CHALLENGE FOR COGNITIVE ARCHAEOLOGY THEN BECOMES ONE OF PENETRATING THE ONTOLOGY OF THIS “RELATIONAL DOMAIN” FROM AN OBJECT-ORIENTED PERSPECTIVE. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, MATERIAL ENGAGEMENT INCORPORATES THREE MAJOR WORKING HYPOTHESES, EACH ONE TARGETING A DIFFERENT BUT COMPLEMENTARY ASPECT OF HUMAN BECOMING - I.E., COGNITION, SIGNIFICATION, AND AGENCY (FIGURE 2): THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE EXTENDED MIND, WHICH EXPLORES THE CONSTITUTIVE INTERTWINING OF COGNITION WITH MATERIAL CULTURE; THE HYPOTHESIS OF ENACTIVE SIGNIFICATION WHICH EXPLORES THE NATURE OF THE MATERIAL SIGN NOT AS A REPRESENTATIONAL MECHANISM BUT AS A SEMIOTIC CONFLATION AND CO- HABITATION THROUGH MATTER THAT ENACTS AND BRINGS FORTH THE WORLD; AND LAST, THE HYPOTHESIS OF MATERIAL AGENCY WHICH EXPLORES AGENCY NOT AS A HUMAN PROPERTY BUT AS THE EMERGENT PRODUCT OF SITUATED ACTIVITY (ASKING NOT ‘WHAT IS AN AGENT?’ BUT ‘WHEN IS AN AGENT?’) V. IF ALL THAT SOUNDS TOO COMPLICATED LET ME PUT IT MORE SIMPLY USING A MORE FAMILIAR PHENOMENOLOGICAL EXAMPLE. THINK OF A BLIND PERSON WITH A STICK. WHERE DOES THE BLIND PERSON’S SELF BEGIN? THIS EXAMPLE, WHICH I BORROW OF COURSE FROM MERLEAU-PONTY (1962) AND GREGORY BATESON (1973), IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITES. IT PROVIDES A TIMELY AND REFRESHING ANALOGY FOR THE PROFOUND EMBODIMENT AND PLASTICITY OF THE HUMAN MIND. IT ALSO HELPS US CONCEPTUALISE THE ONTOLOGICAL UNITY AND CONTINUITY OF MINDS AND THINGS IN THE COURSE OF HUMAN BECOMING. TURNING TOUCH INTO SIGHT THE STICK BECOMES AN INTERFACE OF A PECULIAR TRANSFORMATIVE SORT - WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED A BRAIN- ARTEFACT INTERFACE OR ENACTIVE COGNITIVE PROSTHESIS (MALAFOURIS 2010A; 2008B). WHATEVER ACTUAL FORM THE ‘STICK’ MIGHT HAVE TAKEN IN THE HISTORY OF OUR SPECIES (FROM THE EARLIEST PALEOLITHIC STONE TOOLS TO THE LATEST INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY), ITS PRIMARY FUNCTION WAS THAT OF A PATHWAY FOR THINGING. THROUGH THE ‘STICK’, THE HUMAN SPECIES, MUCH LIKE THE BLIND MAN IN OUR EXAMPLE, FEELS, DISCOVERS, AND MAKES SENSE OF THE ENVIRONMENT, BUT ALSO ENACTS THE WAY FORWARD. LET’S NOT FORGET THAT FROM AN EVOLUTIONARY POINT OF VIEW THE MAIN REASON WE HAVE A BRAIN IS TO MOVE NOT TO CONTEMPLATE. TO BEGIN WITH, MOVING WAS THINKING. I MEAN THAT NOT IN THE COMPUTATIONAL SENSE OF DEVELOPING A BRAIN ABLE TO PRODUCE AND CONTROL ADAPTABLE COMPLEX MOVEMENT. RATHER, I MEAN THAT IN THE ENACTIVE SENSE OF DEVELOPING A MIND WHICH IS “INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO HISTORIES THAT ARE LIVED, MUCH LIKE PATHS THAT EXIST ONLY AS THEY ARE LAID DOWN IN WALKING” (VARELA ET AL. 1991, 205). AND IT SEEMS FAIR TO SAY THAT THE REASON WE CAME TO HAVE OUR META-COGNITIVE CAPACITIES FOR LANGUAGE AND REFLECTIVE THINKING IS THAT UNLIKE ANY OTHER ANIMAL WE GAVE OUR MOVEMENT PURPOSE, CONSCIOUS DIRECTION AND COLLECTIVE MEANING. WE HAD TO USE A STICK TO ACCOMPLISH THAT, SOMETHING CONCRETE, A MATERIAL SCAFFOLD TO THINK THROUGH, WITH AND ABOUT. THIS UNIQUE HUMAN EPISTEMIC PREDISPOSITION FOR MATERIAL ENGAGEMENT CAN EXPLAIN WHY WE HUMANS, MORE THAN ANY OTHER SPECIES, MAKE THINGS, AND HOW THOSE THINGS, IN RETURN, MAKE OUR MINDS WHAT THEY ARE. IT IS ESPECIALLY IN THE LATTER SENSE THAT THE EXAMPLE OF THE BLIND MAN’S STICK ENCAPSULATES THE SPIRIT OF MATERIAL ENGAGEMENT THEORY. IT REMINDS US OF SOMETHING THAT MANY PEOPLE FORGET, NAMELY, THAT NO HUMAN MIND IS EVER COMPLETE. IT IS IN THE NATURE OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCE TO REMAIN AMENABLE TO DRASTIC DEEP REORGANIZATION AND RECONSTITUTION BY INCORPORATING NEW TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS. LET ME EXPLAIN. WE ARE USED TO THINKING OF OUR ‘SAPIENT’ MINDS, WITH ALL OUR UNIQUE CAPACITIES, AS THE APEX OF HUMAN EVOLUTION. BUT I HAVE REPEATEDLY EMPHASISED IN MY WRITINGS THAT THIS VISION OF HUMANITY AS ‘COMPLETE’ AND ‘FIXED’, AND THE CONCOMITANT NEO-DARWINIAN IDEALS OF COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIOURAL ‘MODERNITY’, IS CERTAINLY WRONG. MY APPROACH TO HUMAN EVOLUTION, INSTEAD, SEES THE HUMAN MIND AS AN UNFINISHED PROJECT, IN SOME SENSE ‘BLIND’, AND THUS, POTENTIALLY, IN A PERMANENT STATE OF ON-GOING EVOLUTION. I SAID BEFORE THAT WE HUMANS ARE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER ANIMALS IN THAT WE HAVE MADE THINGING OUR NATURE. I WOULD ALSO INSIST THAT WE HUMANS ARE ALSO A SPECIES ‘INCOMPLETE’ BY NATURE, WHICH ALSO EXPLAINS OUR REMARKABLE PLASTIC QUALITIES AND PROSTHETIC ABILITIES (MALAFOURIS 2013; 2010B). THE EXTRAORDINARY PLASTICITY OF HUMAN MIND AND ITS RECIPROCAL OPENNESS TO CREATIVE EVOLUTION BY WAY OF LEARNING AND TECHNOLOGY BECOMES A DISTINCTIVE FEATURE OF OUR SPECIES. I AM NOT SAYING THAT OTHER SPECIES ARE NOT PLASTIC OR INTELLIGENT IN THEIR OWN SPECIAL WAYS. AND, OBVIOUSLY, I AM NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT BRAIN OR NEURAL PLASTICITY HERE. I TAKE IT WE ALL AGREE THAT THE BRAIN OF HUMANS AND OTHER ANIMALS IS INTRINSICALLY PLASTIC. IT CHANGES BOTH STRUCTURALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY IN RESPONSE TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND EXPERIENCE. WHAT I AM PROPOSING, AND THUS, MY USE OF THE TERM ‘CREATIVE EVOLUTION’ WHICH I BORROW OF COURSE FROM THE FAMOUS BOOK OF HENRI LOUIS BERGSON, IS THAT WE HUMANS, UNLIKE ANY OTHER SPECIES, SEEM TO HAVE MORE THAN JUST A PLASTIC MIND: WE HAVE A MIND WHICH IS ALSO INEXTRICABLY INTERTWINED WITH A PLASTIC CULTURE. I AM TRYING TO GESTURE TOWARDS A DIFFERENT KIND OF PLASTICITY: THE PLASTICITY OF A MIND NOT LIMITED BY THE SKIN. I CALL THAT META-PLASTICITY - WE HAVE A PLASTIC MIND WHICH IS INSEPARABLY CONSTITUTED WITH A PLASTIC CULTURE. THE FOCUS HERE IS ON UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF PLASTIC CHANGES, NOT AT THE LEVEL OF THE INDIVIDUAL, BUT IN THE BROADER SYSTEMIC CONTEXT (CULTURAL OR SOCIAL) WHERE THINGING TAKES PLACE. AT THIS HIGHER LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT WITH THE MATERIAL WORLD WHERE NEURAL AND CULTURAL PLASTICITY INTERACT AND EXCHANGE PROPERTIES, MATERIAL CULTURE COMPETES, EQUALLY WITH ANY OTHER BRAIN REGION, FOR A PLACE IN THE HUMAN COGNITIVE SYSTEM. THE ACTUAL FORCES THAT SHAPE THE DIRECTIONS, SIZE AND CONNECTIONS OF NEURAL FIBERS CAN ONLY BE FOUND ‘OUT THERE’ INTO THE WORLD. AND I ARGUE THAT BEST WAY TO MAKE SENSE OF THAT AND GAIN EMPIRICAL ACCESS TO METAPLASTICITY IS TO FOCUS ON THE REALM OF MATERIAL ENGAGEMENT, THAT IS, WHERE BRAINS, BODIES AND CULTURES CONFLATE. HUMAN BEINGS, UNDERSTOOD AS REAL LIVING CREATURES THAT MOVE AND ACT IN THIS WORLD, ARE THE DEVELOPMENTAL PRODUCTS OF THIS CONFLATION. IF YOU SEPARATE THE THREE - IF YOU SEPARATE BRAIN, BODY AND CULTURE - YOU END UP WITH A NUMBER OF OVERLY SIMPLIFIED ABSTRACTIONS ABOUT LIFELESS CATEGORIES. I AM NOT DENYING THE ANALYTICAL VALUE OF THOSE ABSTRACTIONS FOR MANY DISCIPLINES; BUT I DO THINK THEY ARE MISLEADING WHEN IT COMES TO UNDERSTANDING HUMAN BECOMING. THE DYNAMICAL ACCOUNT OF ACTING AND THINKING THAT THE FOCUS ON THINGING AND MATERIAL ENGAGEMENT BRINGS WITH IT, PROMISES RECONNECTING THE BRAIN WITH THE BODY AND BEYOND, AND BREAKING WITH REDUCTIONISTIC EXPLANATIONS AND THE COGNITIVIST PAST. THIS IS ALSO WHERE POPULAR IDEAS LIKE THAT OF ‘CONNECTOME’ (SPORNS 2011) AND ‘MESHWORK’ (VARELA 1991; INGOLD 2008; KNAPPETT 2011) COULD MEET THE NOTION OF THINGING. A PRECONDITION FOR THAT HOWEVER, IS THE RECOGNITION THAT COGNITION HAS NO A PRIORI LOCATION. THE ACTIVE MIND CANNOT BE EASILY CONTAINED. THINKING IS THINGING. REFERENCES BATESON, G. 1973.
