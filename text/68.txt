WE RAN WORKSHOPS AT THE FACT MEDIA LAB IN LIVERPOOL, DURING MAY/JUNE 2014, IN COLLABORATION WITH MENCAP. OUR LEITMOTIF FOR THE SESSIONS WAS TO ‘TAKE LANGUAGE ON A JOURNEY... AND TWIST IT.’ IN THE FIRST SESSION PARTICIPANTS EXPLORED THE EXHIBITION SCIENCE FICTION: NEW DEATH AT FACT, AS INTRODUCTION TO NEW MEDIA PRACTICES. FOLLOWING THIS PARTICIPANTS WORKED WITH NATHAN JONES PRODUCING POETIC MATERIAL, MIXING APPROPRIATIONIST WRITING STRATEGIES AND CUT-UP TECHNIQUES WITH THEIR OWN WRITING STYLE. SUBSEQUENT SESSIONS WERE RUN WITH POET HANNAH SILVA WHO CONCENTRATED ON THE VOCAL DIMENSION OF THE WORKS AND USED LOOP PEDALS TO ADD FURTHER LAYERS OF EXPERIMENTATION AND TEXTURE TO THE PROCESS AND PARTICIPANTS ALSO WORKED WITH STE COLE FROM EXPERIMENTAL SOUND COLLECTIVE A.P.A.T.T USING SYNTHESISERS, IPAD APPS AND MICS. FINALLY, A VISUAL DIMENSION TO THE WORKS WAS DEVELOPED IN SESSIONS LED BY SAM SKINNER USING IPADS TO PRODUCE TYPOGRAPHIC ANIMATIONS AND FOUND FOOTAGE WAS SOURCED FROM THE WEB TO CREATE COLLAGED VIDEOS EDITED TOGETHER WITH THEIR READINGS AND SOUND WORKS. THE FINAL WORKS CAN BE SEEN ON THE PROJECT TUMBLR: WWW.TORQUETORQUE.TUMBLR.COM JESSICA STEERS -RELAXING ALL AROUND BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS - LOOKING AROUND ALL THE NICE BEACHES WHITE AND BROWN SHELLS I CAN HEAR THE WATER, JUST A FEW BIG BUBBLES THE SMELL OF FLOWERS CLOSE YOUR EYES LOOKING OVER THE WIND YOUR MIND IS LOOKING BACK OVER WIND GO BY YOU CAN HEAR SOUNDS OF FISHES SWIM AND MAKE A SPLASH THEY SWIM DOWN DOWN DOWN LOOK AROUND YOU WITH ALL STARFISHES JUMPING AT YOU, HOPING AND ITS YELLOW AND SMALL SUN COMES, BIG BRIGHT AND YELLOW LOOKS DOWN, IT’S AROUND YOU, MAKE OUR WAY DOWN ONTO THE BEACH WITH ALL THE SEEDS ARE SMALL NICE AND SOFT FEEL THE STONES ROCK MAKE THE SAND GO SOFT RED AND YELLOW PINK BLUE PLANTS AND GET MORE COLOURS THE BLUE SKY WITH SHINE OF WHITE FEEL THE STONES ROCK MAKE THE SAND GO SOFT AND ALL THE STARS ABOVE ALL COMES DOWN ON MAKE THE MOON GO HIGH COMES DOWN THE WATER COMES OVER THE SAND AND MAKES IT COLD HEAR ALL THE SAND AND MAKE IT SOUND LIKE THE WATER GOES IN LISA FRITH -ROBOROSS 197 -A GREEK GOD AND ROBOROSS THE EVER ENDING CIRCLE OF LIFE FORCED TO GROW EXTRA LIMBS TO HOLD ALL OF REASON TOGETHER FOR ALL ETERNITY THE DOOR OPENED A WHITE BACKDROP SUBMERGED IN ALL OF TIME AND SPACE WHEN IT IS SEEN THERE IS DEADLY SILENCE OF WHAT IS TO BECOME ONLY THE STARS KNOW THE TRUTH NO ONE KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT DEATH IT IS THE UNCOMFORTABLE SIDE OF LIFE WHATEVER YOUR RELIGION IT COMES TO ALL OF US JOHN MORGAN - THE BEATLES IN AMERICA - LIFE IS TOO SHORT CHANGE THE SUBJECT TALK ABOUT MUM AND DAD THAT’S LIFE THAT IS LIFE DON’T LOOK BACK, LOOK FORWARD LONG TIME DEAD DON’T LOOK BACK, LOOK FORWARD THAT IS THE PLAN YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE LIGHTS ON LIKE THE BEATLE’S IN AMERICA
