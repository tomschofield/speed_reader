“THE POSITION THAT AN EPOCH OCCUPIES IN THE HISTORICAL PROCESS CAN BE DETERMINED MORE STRIKINGLY FROM AN ANALYSIS OF ITS INCONSPICUOUS SURFACE-LEVEL EXPRESSIONS THAN FROM THAT EPOCH’S JUDGMENTS ABOUT ITSELF.” (SIGFRIED KRACAUER, ‘THE MASS ORNAMENT’ IN THE MASS ORNAMENT, PP. 75-86, P. 75.) I. THESE FRAGMENTS WILL PROBE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GREY MATTER OF THE BRAIN AND THE BRIGHT IMAGES THAT ATTEND IT. II IN PHENOMENOLOGY OF SPIRIT (1807), GWF HEGEL DISCUSSES PHYSIOGNOMY AND PHRENOLOGY, TWO SCIENCES THAT DREW CONCLUSIONS ABOUT PEOPLE’S ESSENTIAL QUALITIES AND DISPOSITIONS FROM THE SHAPES OF THEIR EXTERNAL FEATURES – THEIR FACES AND SKULLS RESPECTIVELY. HEGEL’S DISCUSSION HINGES ON A DISTINCTION BETWEEN DYNAMISM AND STASIS – IN THESE SCIENCES ‘THE MOVEMENT OF CONSCIOUSNESS’ IS OSSIFIED INTO A ‘DEAD THING’. CONSIDERED AS AN EXTERNAL OBJECT THE BRAIN BECOMES ‘SUCH AN INDIFFERENT, NATURAL THING THAT NOTHING ELSE IS TO BE DIRECTLY SEEN IN IT.’ (GEORG WILHELM FRIEDRICH HEGEL, PHENOMENOLOGY OF SPIRIT, TRANS BY A.V. MILLER (OXFORD; OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS, 1979) P. 201.) BUT FOR HEGEL THE BRAIN ‘IS NOTHING IN ITSELF, MUCH LESS HIS [A PERSON’S] TRUE REALITY.’ (HEGEL, PHENOMENOLOGY OF SPIRIT, P. 205.) HEGEL IS IMPLYING HERE THAT WHEN BRAINS ARE ISOLATED FROM HUMAN ACTIVITY, WHEN THEY BECOME OBJECTS RATHER THAN SUBJECTS, THEY CEASE TO HAVE ANY TRUE MEANING AT ALL, THEY DIE. PHRENOLOGY AND PHYSIOGNOMY REDUCE SUBJECTIVITY TO EXTERNAL APPEARANCE ISOLATED FROM THE LIVING SUBJECT’S INTERACTIONS WITH THE WORLD: ‘CONSCIOUSNESS NO LONGER AIMS TO FIND ITSELF IMMEDIATELY, BUT TO PRODUCE ITSELF BY ITS OWN ACTIVITY.’ (HEGEL, PHENOMENOLOGY OF SPIRIT, P. 209.) PHRENOLOGY’S FOUNDER FRANZ JOSEPH GALL CONCEIVED OF THE BRAIN AS AN ORGAN WITH DISTINCT REGIONS, EACH RESPONSIBLE FOR A DIFFERENT ASPECT OF MENTAL LIFE. HE TRAVELLED ACROSS EUROPE PUBLICLY DISSECTING BRAINS AND EXAMINING SKULLS COLLECTED FROM PRISON AND ASYLUM INMATES, WHICH WERE THOUGHT TO DEMONSTRATE INHERENT PROPENSITIES FOR WICKEDNESS OR INSANITY. WITH ITS EMPHASIS ON EMPIRICALLY OBSERVABLE INNATE CAPACITIES, THIS NEW SCIENCE EXHIBITED A SHIFT FROM THE THEOLOGICAL TO THE BIOLOGICAL. BUT EXISTING HIERARCHIES OF RACE, GENDER AND CLASS WERE UPHELD. THE ACT OF OBSERVING WAS NOT A NEUTRAL ONE – CRANIAL BUMPS CAN BE SEEN BUT NOT HEARD AND THE SCIENTIST WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR VENTRILOQUIZING THEM. AFTER HIS DEATH GALL’S BRAIN WAS DONATED TO A FELLOW SCIENTIST, PAUL BROCA, FOR EXAMINATION. IT WAS ASSUMED THAT AN EMINENT ‘MAN OF GENIUS’ LIKE GALL WOULD HAVE A CORRESPONDINGLY VAST BRAIN. BUT GALL’S WAS FOUND TO WEIGH A MEAGRE 1198 GRAMS. BROCA WAS FORCED TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS ANOMALY WHICH, LIKE MANY OTHERS ENCOUNTERED IN HIS RESEARCH, DISRUPTED HIS CLAIM THAT BRAIN SIZE WAS DIRECTLY LINKED TO INTELLIGENCE AND THAT MIDDLE CLASS WHITE MEN HAVE LARGER BRAINS THAT WOMEN, POOR PEOPLE, CRIMINALS AND ‘PRIMITIVES’. BROCA WAS ADEPT AT WORKING AROUND THE NUMEROUS EXCEPTIONS TO THIS ‘RULE’. AS STEPHEN JAY GOULD DISCUSSES ‘DATA COULD NEVER OVERTHROW HIS ASSUMPTIONS.’ (STEPHEN JAY GOULD, THE MISMEASURE OF MAN (NEW YORK, NY; WW NORTON AND COMPANY, 1996), P. 121.) BUT LET’S RETURN BRIEFLY FROM BRAINS TO SKULLS. PHRENOLOGY HAD A MASS APPEAL IN BRITAIN IN THE 19TH CENTURY – IT TRICKLED OUT FROM SCIENTIFIC ESTABLISHMENTS AND DOWN FROM THE UPPER TO THE WORKING CLASSES. 1000S OF CHEAP EDITIONS OF PHRENOLOGICAL WORKS CIRCULATED, ALONGSIDE PAMPHLETS AND LEAFLETS. POPULAR LECTURES, OFTEN FRONTED BY PRACTITIONERS WITH A FLAIR FOR SHOWMANSHIP, WERE WELL-ATTENDED, EVEN IN SMALL VILLAGES. BY THE 1840S PHRENOLOGISTS ALSO FUNCTIONED AS MATERIALIST CLAIRVOYANTS, OFFERING ADVICE ON THE FUTURE FOR A FEW SHILLINGS. (SEE, T. M. PARSSINEN, ‘POPULAR SCIENCE AND SOCIETY: THE PHRENOLOGY MOVEMENT IN EARLY VICTORIAN BRITAIN’, JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY, VOL. 8, NO. 1 (AUTUMN, 1974), PP. 1-20.) IN 1825, JOHN TROTTER PUBLISHED A SATIRICAL TRAVELOGUE UNDER THE PSEUDONYM DON JOSE BALSCOPO. THE NOVEL’S PROTAGONIST CRASHES HIS HOT AIR BALLOON IN THE MYSTERIOUS LAND OF PHRENOLOGASTO WHERE HE ENCOUNTERS A NATION OF PEOPLE WITH HEADS RESEMBLING PHRENOLOGICAL MODELS – THEIR HEADS SHAVED, PAINTED WHITE AND ‘CHALKED OUT BY BLACK LINES INTO A VARIETY OF LITTLE FIELDS AND ENCLOSURES, VERY MUCH IN THE SAME STYLE AS WE SEE A GENTLEMAN’S ESTATE IN ENGLAND LAID OUT ON A MAP.’ THE INHABITANTS OF PHERONOLOGASTO CLOTHE THEMSELVES IN IMAGES OF THE SKULLS OF THEIR ANCESTORS; EVERYONE’S ROLE IN SOCIETY IS DETERMINED BY THE SHAPE OF THEIR HEADS. WHEN BALSCOPO SUBMITS HIMSELF TO A STATE EXAMINATION HE IS BRANDED AN IDIOT, ONLY FIT TO SERVE IN THE LOWEST RANKS OF THE ARMY. BUT EVENTUALLY HE TRANSCENDS THIS PROGNOSIS TO BECOME A DISTINGUISHED MEMBER OF SOCIETY, OVERTURNING THE NATION’S ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT INNATE CAPACITIES. (JOHN TROTTER, TRAVELS IN PHRENOLOGASTO (CALCUTTA [KOLKATA], SAMUEL SMITH AND CO., 1835). THAT THIS BOOK WAS FIRST PUBLISHED IN COLONIAL INDIA BY A MEMBER OF THE EAST INDIA COMPANY CERTAINLY SUGGESTS THAT TROTTER’S OWN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIETY DO NOT PROVIDE A POSITIVE COUNTERPOINT TO THOSE UPHELD BY PHRENOLOGISTS.) TROTTER IMAGINATIVELY EXTENDS THE LOGIC OF THE DOMINANT VISUAL TECHNOLOGY FOR UNDERSTANDING MENTAL LIFE TO THE WHOLE OF SOCIETY. THE RESEMBLANCE OF THE PHRENOLOGICAL HEADS TO THE MAPS USED BY THE LANDED ARISTOCRACY IS A PERTINENT ANALOGY. THE PROP ERTY OWNING CLASSES CARVE UP, SURVEY AND LABEL THE LAND, ENSURING THEIR CONTINUED DOMINANCE OVER IT. THE LAND HAS NO INHERENT PROPERTIES WHICH DESIGNATE IT AS THE PRIVATE PROPERTY OF A PARTICULAR PERSON OR GROUP; THE ACT OF MAPPING CONFERS SUCH MEANINGS ON INERT MATTER. SIMILARLY, THE PHRENOLOGISTS AFFIX LABELS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY SEEM TO INHERE IN SUBJECTS RATHER THAN ADHERE TO THEM. BUT WHAT WOULD THE CONTEMPORARY EQUIVALENT OF PHRENOGASTO LOOK LIKE? WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS OF OUR CURRENT VISUALISATIONS OF THE BRAIN? (THE ANALOGY BETWEEN PHRENOLOGY AND CONTEMPORARY BRAIN IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES IS MADE BY WILLIAM R. UTTAL, THE NEW PHRENOLOGY: THE LIMITS OF LOCALIZING COGNITIVE PROCESSES IN THE BRAIN (CAMBRIDGE, MA; MIT PRESS, 2003) AND ELSEWHERE.) OUR CONTEMPORARY BALSCOPO MIGHT BE BEWILDERED TO FIND HIMSELF IN THIS MYSTERIOUS NEW TERRITORY. FOR THERE HE WOULD NOT FIND PEOPLE WITH WHITE SKULLS COVERED IN NEAT BLACK LINES MOVING AROUND IN A RECOGNISABLY TERRESTRIAL LANDSCAPE, BUT FLUORESCENT DISEMBODIED SHAPES CAST ADRIFT IN A FEATURELESS BLACK ABYSS. II I CAN THE MIND BE SEEN IN THE BRAIN? ON MARCH 9TH 2014 JACK BELLIVEAU, THE FIRST SCIENTIST TO CREATE A MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGE OF HUMAN BRAIN FUNCTION, DIED. IN THE WORDS OF THE NEW YORK TIMES OBITUARY HIS WAS A ‘QUEST TO CAPTURE THE QUICKSILVER FLARE OF THOUGHT INSIDE A LIVING BRAIN’. (HTTP://WWW. NYTIMES. COM/ 2014/ 03/ 10/ SCIENCE/ JACK- BELLIVEAU- EXPLORER-OF- THE- BRAIN- DIES-AT- 55.HTML) ONE OF BELLIVEAU’S IMAGES MADE THE COVER OF SCIENCE IN NOVEMBER 1991. THE IMAGE REVEALED AN INCREASED VOLUME OF BLOOD IN THE ACTIVATED VISUAL CORTEX. FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (FM.R.I.) PRODUCES IMAGES BY DETECTING SIGNALS FROM THE HYDROGEN ATOMS OF WATER MOLECULES SURROUNDING THE VESSELS THAT DELIVER BLOOD TO THE BRAIN, RELYING ON THE MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF HAEMOGLOBIN. ALTHOUGH THE SUBTRACTIVE METHOD USED TO OBTAIN THE MAGAZINE’S COVER IMAGE WAS ALREADY OBSOLETE BY THE TIME THE JOURNAL WAS PUBLISHED, THE IMAGE BECAME ICONIC. THE ORIGINAL 1991 PUBLICATION CAN BE ACCESSED HERE: HTTP://WWW. NCBI. NLM. NIH.GOV/ PUBMED/ 1948051 SEE ALSO: HTTP:// WWW. SCIENCEDIRECT. COM/ SCIENCE/ARTICLE/ PII/ S1053811 912004 223) GEORGE BUSH SR FAMOUSLY DECLARED THE 1990S TO BE THE DECADE OF THE BRAIN. A GLANCE AT THE NEW YORK TIMES ARCHIVES DURING THAT DECADE REVEALS THAT REFERENCES TO FMRI BECAME INCREASINGLY COMMON AS THE 90S UNFOLDED11 – FROM INITIAL REPORTS ON THE EXISTENCE OF THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY TO ARTICLES COVERING RESEARCH INTO ALZHEIMER’S, LANGUAGE ACQUISITION, DRUG USE AND (MORE DISTURBINGLY) EVIDENCE OF BIOLOGICAL GENDER DIFFERENCE. (MY FOCUS IS ON THE NON-SCIENTIFIC PRESS AS I AM INTERESTED IN POPULAR REPRESENTATIONS OF THE BRAIN. FOR A STATISTICAL OVERVIEW OF STUDIES DRAWING ON FMRI PUBLISHED IN SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS SEE, JOELLE M. ABI-RACHED, NEURO: THE NEW BRAIN SCIENCES AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THE MIND (PRINCETON; PRINCETON UNIVERSITY PRESS, 2013) P. 74. THEY TRACE A HUGE INCREASE IN ‘EXPERT’ INTEREST - FROM 146 PAPERS IN 1990 TO ALMOST 7000 IN 2009. AN INTERESTING DISCUSSION OF CURRENT BRAIN IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES IS PROVIDED IN JEANETTE EDWARDS, PENNY HARVEY AND PETER WADE ED. TECHNOLOGIZED IMAGES, TECHNOLOGIZED BODIES (NEW YORK, NY; BERGHAN BOOKS, 2010)). THE EARLIER ARTICLES, WRITTEN BEFORE MAGNETIC IMAGING TECHNOLOGY HAD BECOME FAMILIAR, HIGHLIGHT THE LIMITATIONS OF THE PROCEDURE. A NEUROLOGIST AT YALE CAUTIONS IN 1992 THAT MAKING ASSERTIONS ABOUT THE FUNCTIONING OF THE BRAIN BASED ON BLOOD FLOW IS ‘AN ENORMOUS LEAP’. (HTTP://WWW. NYTIMES. COM/ 2014/ 03/ 10/ SCIENCE/ JACK- BELLIVEAU-EXPLORER- OF- THE- BRAIN- DIES- AT- 55.HTML) BUT THESE CAVEATS TEND TO DISAPPEAR AS THE DECADE PROGRESSES. THE FALLIBILITY OF THE TECHNOLOGY FADES FROM VIEW. THE TENSION BETWEEN THE QUICKSILVER FLARE OF THOUGHT AND THE STATIC DULL MASS ACROSS WHICH IT FLASHES SEEMS TO HAVE A VISUAL COUNTERPART IN IMAGES OF THE BRAIN, WHICH TRANSFORM A GREY LUMP OF FLESH INTO A COLOURFUL, DYNAMIC, DIGITIZED PICTURE. BUT THE BRIGHTNESS ON DISPLAY IN THOSE IMAGES SHOULD NOT BE MISTAKEN WITH THE QUALITATIVE EXPERIENCE OF THOUGHT ITSELF. FMRI MIGHT VISUALIZE BRAIN FUNCTION BUT IT DOES NOT PRODUCE IMAGES OF OUR EMOTIONS AND DESIRES, FEELINGS AND ANXIETIES, HOPES AND FEARS. AS GAYLE RUBIN NOTES IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT, BIOLOGY CAN ONLY EVER TELL US SO MUCH (AS BIOLOGISTS THEMSELVES ARE OFTEN THE FIRST TO ADMIT): ‘THE BELLY’S HUNGER GIVES NO CLUES AS TO THE COMPLEXITIES OF CUISINE.’ (GAYLE RUBIN, ‘THINKING SEX: NOTES FOR A RADICAL THEORY IN SEXUALITY’ IN RICHARD PARKER AND PETER AGGLETON ED. CULTURE, SOCIETY AND SEXUALITY (LONDON; ROUTLEDGE, 1999), PP. 150- 187. THE ANTI-ESSENTIALISM OF THIS SEMINAL FEMINIST TEXT IS PERTINENT HERE AS RUBIN MANAGES TO CONVEY THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL CONTINGENCY OF IDENTITY WITHOUT DISPENSING WITH FLESHY BODIES. SHE ALSO DISCUSSES HOW BIOLOGICAL CATEGORIZATIONS AND VOCABULARIES ARE QUIETLY INVOLVED IN THE DEMONIZATION OF GROUPS THAT DEVIATE FROM THE (HETERO)NORM.) BUT THE SHIMMERING COLOURS OF THESE IMAGES ARE IMBUED WITH AESTHETIC SIGNIFICANCE. WE LIVE IN A CULTURE IN WHICH BRIGHTNESS AND DARKNESS, VIBRANCY AND THE MONOCHROMATIC, DYNAMISM AND STASIS HAVE PROFOUNDLY EMOTIONAL CONNOTATIONS. ‘NO-ONE CAN REASONABLY WATCH THE FRENZIED, LOCALIZED ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN OF A PERSON DRIVEN BY SOME OBSESSION, OR SEE THE DULL GLOW OF A DEPRESSED BRAIN, AND STILL DOUBT THAT THESE ARE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS,’ DECLARES RITA CARTER IN MAPPING THE MIND. (RITA CARTER, MAPPING THE MIND (LONDON; WEIDERFELD AND NICHOLSON, 1998) CITED IN NIKOLAS ROSE AND JOELLE M. ABI- RACHED, NEURO, P. 53.) HERE THE MOVEMENTS AND LIGHTS THAT APPEAR IN FMRI ARE DIRECTLY EQUATED WITH MENTAL STATES. BUT THIS IS A METAPHORICAL PROCESS. HAPPY BRAINS DO NOT SHINE AND DEPRESSED BRAINS DO NOT EMIT A DULL GLOW; THE DIM LIGHT PRODUCED BY THE IMAGE DOES NOT DIRECTLY CORRESPOND TO A GLOOMY DISPOSITION (HOWEVER MUCH OUR VALUE-LADEN LANGUAGE SUGGESTS OTHERWISE). IV DURING HIS CONVALESCENCE AT AN ALPINE SANATORIUM HANS CASTORP, THE AILING HERO OF THOMAS MANN’S THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN (1924), PAYS A VISIT TO THE X-RAY LABORATORY. THE X-RAY WAS INVENTED IN 1896, INTRODUCING A RADICALLY NEW WAY OF LOOKING NOT AT BUT THROUGH HUMAN BODIES. (ON THE HISTORY OF THE X-RAY SEE, BETYANN HOLTZMANN KEVLES, NAKED TO THE BONE: MEDICAL IMAGING IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY (NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ; RUTGERS UNIVERSITY PRESS, 1997).) THE RESIDENT DOCTOR HAILS WITH CONFIDENT ENLIGHTENED ZEAL THIS ‘ILLUMINATED ANATOMY, THE TRIUMPH OF THE AGE.’ (THOMAS MANN, THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN, TRANS. BY JOHN E WOODS (LONDON; EVERYMAN, 2005) P. 256) CASTORP REFERS AGAIN AND AGAIN TO THE ‘STRANDS WITH NODULES’ THAT APPEAR ON HIS X-RAY IMAGE: AN EMPIRICAL TESTAMENT TO HIS ILLNESS. HE CARRIES HIS X-RAY PHOTOGRAPH IN HIS WALLET AS ‘A KIND OF IDENTIFICATION. LIKE A PASSPORT OR A MEMBERSHIP CARD.’ (MAGIC MOUNTAIN, P. 287) BUT THE NARRATIVE CAPTURES THE TENSION BETWEEN SCIENTIFIC RATIONALITY AND THE QUEASY, UNCANNY EFFECT ITS IMAGES PRODUCE; THE PHYSICAL IS METAPHYSICAL. X-RAYS DO NOT DISENCHANT THE WORLD BUT IMBUE IT WITH GREATER MYSTERY. ENTERING THE ‘ARTIFICIAL TWILIGHT’ (MAGIC MOUNTAIN, P. 251) OF THE X-RAY ROOM WITH ITS SPARKS AND SIZZLES OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY, RED LIGHTS AND GREEN GLOWS, THE IMAGE THAT EMERGES IS ‘PHANTOM LIKE AND HAZY, LIKE A FOG OR A PALE, UNCERTAIN AURA,’ (MAGIC MOUNTAIN, P. 256) A ‘SOFT HALO OF FLESH... A WEB OF DARKER SPOTS AND BLACKISH RUFFLES.’ (MAGIC MOUNTAIN, P. 259, P. 288, P. 259) THE PROCEDURE HAS A HAUNTING, MYSTICAL QUALITY. BY STRIPPING LIVING FLESH FROM THE BONE, THE X-RAY PROVIDES A GLIMPSE INTO THE GRAVE. IT FUNCTIONS AS A PREMONITION OF DEATH. THE MILKY FRAME THAT APPEARS AGAINST THE TRANSLUCENT DARKNESS IS ‘SEPULCHRAL’, ‘FUNEREAL’, A ‘GAUNT MEMENTO MORI’. (MAGIC MOUNTAIN, P. 256) FOR CASTORP, X-RAY IMAGES ARE MACABRE, MOVING, OTHERWORLDLY. HE LIKENS THE EXPERIENCE TO A CLAIRVOYANT AUNT WHO SAW PEOPLE AS SKELETONS PRIOR TO THEIR DEATHS. BUT THESE IMAGES ALSO PROVIDE STRANGE INSIGHTS INTO LIVING BEINGS. GAZING AT HIS COUSIN JOACHIM’S X-RAYED FORM, HANS IS DISTRACTED BY A ‘SACK, OR MAYBE A DEFORMED ANIMAL... LIKE SOME SORT OF FLAPPING JELLYFISH.’ THIS CURIOUS CREATURE TURNS OUT TO BE HIS COMPANION’S ‘HONOUR-LOVING HEART’. (MAGIC MOUNTAIN, P. 414) HANS IS DEEPLY MOVED BY THIS SIGHT; THE HEART IS MORE THAN A FLESHY ORGAN BUT THE SEAT OF EMOTIONS AND LOVE. HE KEEPS AN X-RAY PHOTOGRAPH OF HIS BELOVED IN HIS POCKET AND PRESSES IT TO HIS LIPS IN HER ABSENCE - ‘WITHOUT A FACE, BUT REVEALING THE ORGANS OF HER CHEST CAVITY AND THE TENDER FRAMEWORK OF HER UPPER BODY, DELICATELY SURROUNDED BY SOFT, GHOSTLIKE FORMS OF HER FLESH.’ (MAGIC MOUNTAIN, P. 414) THE NEUROPHILOSOPHER PAUL CHURCHLAND IS SIMILARLY SAID TO CARRY AN IMAGE OF HIS WIFE’S BRAIN IN HIS WALLET. BRUNO LATOUR ARGUES THAT CARRYING A PHOTOGRAPH OF HER FACE WOULD BE NO MORE OR LESS RATIONAL AS THIS IS ALSO A TECHNOLOGICALLY MEDIATED REPRESENTATION, ALBEIT A MORE SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE ONE. NEITHER IMAGE PROVIDES A DIRECT REPRESENTATION OF THE ESSENCE OF SUBJECTIVITY.(BRUNO LATOUR, ‘HOW TO TALK ABOUT THE BODY? THE NORMATIVE DIMENSION OF SCIENCE STUDIES,’ BODY & SOCIETY, VOL. 10, JUNE 2004, PP. 205-229.) BUT THE MEDIATIONS INVOLVED HERE ARE QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT. THE MORE ‘SCIENTIFIC’ IMAGE IS THE MORE ABSTRACT. A PHOTOGRAPH REPRODUCES THE WORLD IN A RECOGNISABLE, IF DISTORTED MANNER, WHEREAS THE IMAGES PRODUCED BY BRAIN SCANS, LIKE THE GHOSTLY X-RAY VISIONS DISCUSSED BY MANN, USHER THE VIEWER INTO AN ALIEN TERRAIN. WE ARE NOT REALLY AT HOME IN OUR INTERPRETED WORLD. THE COVER STORY OF THE MARCH 2014 EDITION OF SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN IS DEDICATED TO ‘THE CENTURY OF THE BRAIN’. THE COVER IMAGE (SEE PAGE 77) DEPICTS BRIGHT FOLDS OF MULTI-COLOURED FIBRES ENCASING A GLOWING YELLOW CORE. STRANGE SHAFTS OF LIGHT AND IRIDESCENT STREAKS RADIATE FROM A DISEMBODIED CENTRAL GLOBULE THAT CORUSCATES WITHIN ITS OBSIDIAN SURROUNDINGS. WHEN I LOOK AT THIS IMAGE I SEE A SEA ANEMONE FLOATING ABOVE A CORAL REEF, A RAPTUROUS HEART, AN OIL SLICK IN A DARK CAVERN, A BLUE FISHING NET CATCHING A LAMP, TWINKLING EMBERS, AN ALIEN SPACESHIP VENTURING INTO THE UNKNOWN. THE GARISH COLOURS EMPLOYED HERE DO NOT BARE MUCH RESEMBLANCE TO THE GREY MATTER IN OUR HEADS AND CERTAINLY FAIL TO GESTURE TOWARDS THE WORLD BEYOND IT. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE IMAGE IS GENERATED BY MACHINES USED TO ANALYSE BRAIN FUNCTION OR IS AN ARTIST’S IMPRESSION. THE BOLD GLOWING COVER PICTURE DOES NOT SEEM VASTLY DISSIMILAR FROM THE COVER IMAGE ON SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN THAT APPEARED THE SUBSEQUENT MONTH, OF DISTANT GALAXIES. WHAT DOES THIS IMAGE PROCLAIM EXACTLY? PERHAPS LITTLE ELSE THAN THE DAZZLING INNOVATIVE QUALITIES OF SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY AS SUCH – SO INNOVATIVE! SO SHINY! SO CUTTING EDGE! AREN’T THE MACHINES AND BRILLIANT MINDS THAT POWER THEM IMPRESSIVE? AND ULTIMATELY, OF COURSE, BEYOND OUR COMPREHENSION. THE INJUNCTION IS TO GAZE IN AWE, TO MARVEL AT THIS MOST ADVANCED FORM OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE. IN THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN ARTICLE ITSELF TWO NEUROSCIENTISTS DISCUSS THE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES THAT MIGHT PROVIDE NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE MYSTERIOUS GREY LUMP IN OUR SKULLS – AS IT IS INVARIABLY DESCRIBED IN ARTICLE AFTER ARTICLE. THESE SCIENTISTS ARE QUICK TO POINT TO THE LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT BRAIN IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES WHICH THEY ACKNOWLEDGE ARE FAR FROM TRANSPARENT REPRESENTATIONS OF CONSCIOUSNESS. THE ARTICLE IS POPULATED BY STRANGE, ALMOST MYSTICAL SOUNDING CREATURES AND MATERIALS. THEY DISCUSS NEEDLE-LIKE ELECTRODES PRODDING INTO THE BRAINS OF ANIMALS IN LABORATORIES AND MOLECULE-SIZED MATERIALS THAT MIGHT BE INSERTED INTO THE CEREBRAL CORTEX TO TRACK THE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY OF NEURONS. ONE OF THE ARTICLE’S AUTHORS HAS EXPERIMENTED WITH THE LARVAL ZEBRA FISH, WHOSE TRANSPARENT FLESH ALLOWS FOR ITS BRAIN ACTIVITY TO BE EASILY OBSERVED (ALTHOUGH HOW SIMILAR THIS CREATURE IS TO A HUMAN REMAINS OBSCURE). THE FISH’S NEURONS WERE GENETICALLY ENGINEERED TO FLOURESCE WHEN CALCIUM IONS ENTER THE CELL. LATER THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES NANODIAMONDS, WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF REGISTERING THE ELECTRICAL FLUCTUATIONS OF A CELL AND ENDOSCOPES WHICH ARE BEING DEVELOPED TO PEER INSIDE SKULLS, GAINING ACCESS THROUGH VESSELS OR ARTERIES. TO THE LAY PERSON – OR AT LEAST TO ME – THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES EVOKE SOMETHING INTRIGUING, WEIRD, SURPRISING. THEY’RE ENGAGING TO READ ABOUT. BUT THEY DON’T REALLY TELL ME VERY MUCH ABOUT MY BRAIN OR MYSELF. POPULAR SCIENCE WRITING IS GROUNDED IN THE PROMISE OF SOMETHING TO COME – PREMISED ON POSITIVIST ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY. THE BRAIN MIGHT BE GREY AND MYSTERIOUS TODAY BUT TOMORROW...? YET AMID ALL THE FUTURISTIC- SOUNDING INNOVATIONS, THE PROBLEMS NEUROSCIENCE FACES ARE OLD AND STUBBORN – LIKE THE FACT THAT LIVING BRAINS TEND TO BE ENCASED IN BONE WHICH MAKES THEM DIFFICULT TO SEE INSIDE. THE WHOLLY ENLIGHTENED EARTH IS RADIANT WITH TRIUMPHANT BANALITY. IN THESE ACCOUNTS OF NEW IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES, THE LANGUAGE IS OFTEN AS LURID AS THE IMAGES. ON MY TRAWL THROUGH THE NEW YORK TIMES ARCHIVES I CAME ACROSS A LONG FEATURE WRITTEN BY STEPHEN S HALL IN 1999 ENTITLED ‘JOURNEY TO THE CENTRE OF MY MIND’ IN WHICH THE JOURNALIST UNDERWENT A SERIES OF FMRI SCANS. METAPHORS ABOUND. IMAGES OF BRAIN OFTEN RESEMBLE SPACESHIPS CIRCULATING IN A DARK GALAXY, BUT IN WRITTEN ACCOUNTS OF NEUROSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IT IS THE SCIENTIST WHO IS CAST AS THE INTREPID EXPLORER VENTURING INTO THE UNKNOWN CEREBRAL STRATOSPHERE. NON-SCIENTIFIC OR POPULAR SCIENTIFIC ACCOUNTS OF BRAIN FUNCTION TEND TO EMPLOY TROPES FROM IMPERIALIST ADVENTURE NARRATIVES – THE BRAIN IS THE FINAL FRONTIER TO BE DISCOVERED, AND IF WE FOLLOW THE COLONIAL METAPHOR TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSION, DOMINATED, CONTROLLED, EXPLOITED. HALL SAYS HE EMBARKED ON AN ‘ADVENTURE’ INTO THE ‘DARK WOOD OF COGNITION’ ACROSS THE ‘DAUNTING FRONTIER’ INTO HIS BRAIN. THE SCIENTISTS, HE SAYS, ARE LIKE PIONEERS IN COVERED WAGONS WHO HAVE NOW ESTABLISHED A ‘BEACHHEAD ON A VAST, UNCHARTED CONTINENT’. HE DESCRIBES HIS ACCOUNT AS A ‘NEURONAL PICARESQUE’ AKIN TO DANTE’S JOURNEY INTO HELL. THE IMAGE OF HIS BRAIN IS ‘LIKE THOSE AERIAL SHOTS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA’ OR ‘LIKE A CHOPIN IMPROMPTU’ OR LIKE A LANDSCAPE WITH A RIVER RUNNING THROUGH IT OR LIKE ‘THE WALL OF NAPALM SCENE IN APOCALYPSE NOW’ OR LIKE ‘A NEON SIGN ON A CHEAP DINER’. THE TENSION HALL DESCRIBES THROUGHOUT IS BETWEEN THE ‘STRANGE COMMINGLING OF INERT ANATOMY AND TRANSCENDENT HUMAN QUALITIES.’ BUT ULTIMATELY DESPITE ALL THE FLASHES OR RIVERS OR FOLDS THAT HE WITNESSES HIS BRAIN REMAINS OPAQUE. THOSE ‘VOLUPTUOUS, SERPENTINE FOLDS OF CORTEX’ THAT HE DESCRIBES SO LAVISHLY DO NOT ULTIMATELY YIELD VERY MUCH. SOMEWHERE, HE OPINES, THE BRAIN MUST HARBOUR CHILDHOOD MEMORIES, THE CAPACITY TO SPEAK FOREIGN LANGUAGES, POP SONG LYRICS, THE CONTOURS OF PEOPLE’S FACES – ‘ALL NESTLED AND SYNAPTICALLY ETCHED IN THIS BLAND GREY AND SQUISHY LANDSCAPE’ – BUT FOR ALL HIS TORTUROUS NARRATIVE EXERTIONS, FOR ALL THE BRIGHT METAPHORICAL IMAGES HE LACES HIS TEXT WITH, THE GREY SQUISHINESS PERSISTS IN BEING GREY AND SQUISHY. (HTTP:// WWW. NYTIMES. COM/1999/ 06/ 06/ MAGAZINE/ JOURNEY- TO- THE- CENTER- OF-MY- MIND. HTML) IF A LIGHT IS TOO BRIGHT THE GLARE OBSCURES MORE THAN IT REVEALS. ALONGSIDE THOSE PERTAINING TO COLOUR, THE OED CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING DEFINITIONS OF GREY: LACKING HOPE, PLEASURE, OR CHEERFULNESS; DISMAL, GLOOMY; SAD, DEPRESSING LACKING INDIVIDUALITY, DULL AND NONDESCRIPT; BORING, CHARACTERLESS; (ALSO) ANONYMOUS, FACELESS. SOMETIMES WITH CONNOTATIONS OF CONFORMITY OR BUREAUCRACY BUT A THIRD DEFINITION SUGGESTS A POSSIBLE MEANS OF SUBVERTING THIS: OF A THING: AMBIGUOUS; NOT EASILY DEFINED OR CATEGORIZED; NOT BLACK AND WHITE; INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN DIRECTLY OPPOSING NOTIONS OF GOOD OR BAD, RIGHT OR WRONG, ETC. ‘GREY IS EVERY THEORY BUT EVER GREEN IS THE TREE OF LIFE’. THIS OFTEN QUOTED LINE FROM GOETHE’S FAUST INSISTS THAT SCIENTIFIC ABSTRACTION DRAINS REALITY OF ITS RICHNESS AND BEAUTY. BUT IN THE EXAMPLES DISCUSSED HERE, WE ARE BOMBARDED WITH BRIGHT IMAGES AND FLORID PROSE TO COMPENSATE FOR THE OBDURATE GREYNESS OF CONCRETE NATURE. REBECCA COMAY SUGGESTS THAT THE LURID GREEN BEING PROFFERED IN GOETHE’S FORMULATION INVOKES ‘THE SHIMMER OF A LIFE NUMB TO ITS OWN SUFFERING AND COLD TO THE FAILURE ON WHICH IT FEEDS’ (REBECCA COMAY, MOURNING SICKNESS: HEGEL AND THE FRENCH REVOLUTION (STANFORD, STANFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS, 2011), P. 159): BRIGHTNESS IS INCAPABLE OF ILLUMINATING THE GREYNESS OF LIFE. FOR COMAY VISIONS OF GREYNESS TRADITIONALLY ‘MARK THE EXHAUSTION OF THE PRESENT – A FADED LANDSCAPE IN WHICH THERE IS NOTHING TO TAKE OVER AND NOTHING TO PASS ON.’ (COMAY, P. 143.) COMAY EXPLICITLY LINKS THIS MONOCHROME IMAGE TO THE REPETITIVE RHYTHMS AND APPARENT INESCAPABILITY OF ADVANCED INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISM. BUT SHE, THROUGH A METICULOUS READING OF HEGEL, SUGGESTS AN ALTERNATIVE: ‘FAR FROM SIGNALLING A SIMPLE ENTROPY OR ATROPHY OF POSSIBILITIES, IT IS CREPUSCULAR GREY, NOT GLOWING GREEN OR GOLD, THAT MARKS THE CHOMATIC OPENING TO A NEW BEGINNING; IT IS FROM THE ASHES OF LOST OPPORTUNITY THAT SPIRIT QUICKENS.’ (COMAY, P. 159.) THEODOR ADORNO DISCUSSES BECKETT’S ENDGAME AS THE EXEMPLARY WORK OF ART AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR. BECKETT SUCCEEDS IN CAPTURING THE ‘BOMBED- OUT CONSCIOUSNESS’ (THEODOR W. ADORNO, ‘TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ENDGAME’TRANS BY MICHAEL T. JONES, NEW GERMAN CRITIQUE, NO. 26, CRITICAL THEORY AND MODERNITY (SPRING - SUMMER, 1982), PP. 119-150, P. 123.) THAT EMERGES FROM THE DEBRIS, A SMASHED SUBJECTIVITY THAT CAN NO LONGER REFLECT ON ITSELF. BUT ADORNO DISCERNS A GLINT OF HOPE IN BECKETT’S WORK: THE TERRAIN IN ENDGAME IS NOT EMPTY, IT IS ALMOST EMPTY. AN ‘OBLIQUE LIGHT’ SHINES. (ADORNO,‘TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ENDGAME’, P. 146.) BECKETT SPECIFIES THAT THE ACTION PLAYS OUT UNDER A GREY LIGHT. WHEN CLOV LOOKS THROUGH HIS TELESCOPE HE SEES ‘GREY – GREY – GREY’ (OR PERHAPS ‘LIGHT BLACK’).(SAMUEL BECKETT, ENDGAME (LONDON, FABER AND FABER, 2006)) THE LIGHT IS FEEBLE, CERTAINLY, BUT IT IS NOT IDENTICAL WITH DARKNESS. IN THIS NEAR DARKNESS, THAT MIGHT BE ALIGNED WITH THE GREY DESCRIBED BY COMAY: ‘CONSCIOUSNESS BEGINS TO LOOK ITS OWN DEMISE IN THE EYE, AS IF IT WANTED TO SURVIVE THE DEMISE.’ (THEODOR W. ADORNO,‘TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ENDGAME’, P. 150.) THIS DULL CHINK OF LIGHT IS WHAT CONSTITUTES THE PLOT OF ENDGAME: ‘THE TINY BIT THAT IS ALSO EVERYTHING – THAT WOULD BE THE POSSIBILITY THAT SOMETHING COULD PERHAPS CHANGE.’ (THEODOR W. ADORNO,‘TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ENDGAME’, P. 146.) FOR ADORNO, THE GREYNESS OF BECKETT’S WORK IS PRECISELY WHERE ITS BRIGHTNESS LAYS: “IF BECKETT’S PLAYS, AS CREPUSCULARLY GREY AS AFTER SUNSET AND THE END OF THE WORLD, WANT TO EXORCISE CIRCUS COLOURS, THEY YET REMAIN TRUE TO THEM... EVEN ARTWORKS THAT INCORRUPTIBLY REFUSE CELEBRATION AND CONSOLATION DO NOT WIPE OUT RADIANCE, AND THE GREATER THEIR SUCCESS, THE MORE THEY GAIN IT. TODAY THIS LUSTRE DEVOLVES PRECISELY UPON WORKS THAT ARE INCONSOLABLE.” (THEODOR W. ADORNO, AESTHETIC THEORY, TRANS BY ROBERT HULLOT-KENTOR (LONDON; CONTINUUM, 1997) PP. 81-82) ADORNO DISCUSSES THE AUSTERITY OF MODERNIST ART, SUGGESTING THAT A PALATE THAT RENOUNCES COLOUR HAS MORE SPARKLE THAN THE VIBRANT GLARE OF MUCH POPULAR CULTURE: ‘THE HIGHER THE QUALITY OF A WORK, THE GREATER ITS BRILLIANCE, AND THIS IS MOST STRIKINGLY THE CASE IN THE INSTANCE OF THOSE GREY-ON-GREY WORKS OF MODERNISM THAT ECLIPSE HOLLYWOOD’S TECHNICOLOR.’ (THEODOR W. ADORNO, AESTHETIC THEORY, P. 297.) A RAINBOW-FEATHERED STUFFED BIRD OF PARADISE ONCE FUNCTIONED AS A UTOPIAN VISION BUT SUCH AN IMAGE IS NO LONGER TENABLE: ‘THE TENEBROUS HAS BECOME THE PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THAT UTOPIA.’ (THEODOR W. ADORNO, AESTHETIC THEORY, P. 135.) IN A TENEBROUS WORLD, VISIONS OF THE SELF AS ILLUMINATED SPLOTCHES IN THE DIGITAL DARK PROVIDE A SUPERFICIAL SOLACE. THEY MAP COMFORTABLY ONTO THE PRESENT TERRAIN - DETACHED FROM HUMAN LIFE, THE CONVOLUTIONS OF HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE THAT SHAPE EXISTENCE FADE INTO THE BLACKNESS. IN A SIMILAR VEIN TO ADORNO, SIEGFRIED KRACAUER REFUSED TO ALIGN BRIGHT LIGHTS AND COLOURS WITH INTELLECTUAL ILLUMINATION. HE USED THE FOLLOWING METAPHOR TO DESCRIBE THE LIVES OF WHITE COLLAR WORKERS IN INTERWAR BERLIN: “IN THE LUNA PARK, OF AN EVENING, A FOUNTAIN IS SOMETIMES DISPLAYED ILLUMINATED BY BENGAL LIGHTS. CONES OF RED, YELLOW AND GREEN LIGHT, CONTINUALLY RECREATED, FLEE INTO THE DARKNESS. WHEN THE SPLENDOUR IS GONE, IT TURNS OUT TO HAVE COME FROM THE WRETCHED CARTILAGINOUS STRUCTURE OF A FEW LITTLE PIPES. THE FOUNTAIN RESEMBLES THE LIFE OF MANY EMPLOYEES. FROM ITS WRETCHEDNESS IT ESCAPES INTO DISTRACTION, LETS ITSELF BE ILLUMINATED WITH BENGAL LIGHTS AND, UNMINDFUL OF ITS ORIGIN, DISSOLVES INTO THE NOCTURNAL VOID.”(SIEGFRIED KRACAUER, THE SALARIED MASSES: DUTY AND DISTRACTION IN WEIMAR GERMANY, TRANS BY QUINTIN HOARE (LONDON; VERSO, 1998) P. 95) POPULAR REPRESENTATIONS OF THE BRAIN OFTEN HAVE A SIMILARLY DAZZLING FUNCTION. BUT BEHIND THE IMAGES BRAINS CONTINUE THEIR FLESHY EXISTENCE. THESE BRAINS DO NOT LIVE IN A NOCTURNAL VOID BUT ARE EMBEDDED IN BODIES THAT MOVE ABOUT IN THE WORLD. ATTENDING TO DULL, SQUISHY REALITY IN ALL ITS OPACITY MIGHT PARADOXICALLY REVEAL MORE ABOUT HUMAN SUBJECTIVITY THAN CONSTANTLY ATTEMPTING TO PROCLAIM THAT ITS SECRETS HAVE ALREADY BEEN LAID BARE UNDER THE COLD, HARSH STRIP LIGHTS OF SCIENTIFIC RATIONALITY.
