SKETCHES FOR MIND TWIST, 1975 COURTESY DENNIS OPPENHEIM STUDIO/ARCHIVE EXCERPT FROM SOUNDTRACK: “PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE STAYED ON THAT ROAD - THAT ROAD BACK THERE - SEE IT - SEE HOW IT WAS CROSSED OVER...DOUBLE CROSSED IN TWO PLACES... I MADE A DETOUR – CHANGED DIRECTION. WHY DID I FEEL A CURVE COMING, IT WAS A STRAIGHT COURSE? BUT I MADE A SLIGHT TURN - THEN THE MOMENTUM STARTED - I MADE ANOTHER SLIGHT TURN, THE MOVEMENT THEN WAS CIRCULAR - EACH OPERATION DESTROYING THE PRECEDING ONE. AND THAT LAND...ALL THAT LAND AHEAD OF ME, FINALLY GOT TO ACTUAL SPACE - ACTUAL TIME. I LET IT ATTACK ME - OVERPOWER ME - I LET IT TURN MYSELF IN ON MYSELF. FIRST TWIST, THE DETOUR THAT STARTED THIS CONTINUED, CIRCULAR PATH - THIS ROAD THAT GOES NOWHERE...HOW I REMEMBER THAT FEELING - THAT TEMPTATION TO TWIST MY MIND - TO TWIST MY THOUGHTS AROUND - I’M SURE IT’S LIKE COMMITTING MURDER, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IT TAKES A TWISTED MIND - A MIND THAT CAN TURN AGAINST ITSELF...TO STAY ON THIS COURSE. I WANTED TO SHOW YOU STRAIGHT, CLEAR LINES BY NOW - ALL THIS TRAVELLING - I WANTED YOU TO LOOK DOWN A CLEAR ROAD AND SEE THE BEGINNING AND THE END; TO SHOW YOU A THOUGHT WELL TRAVELLED IN SPACE - BUT I’M SHOWING YOU THIS AS IT IS, I WANT YOU TO SEE WHAT TAKES A TWISTED MIND TO RECOGNIZE.” TRANSCRIPT FROM MIND TWIST, 1975 COURTESY DENNIS OPPENHEIM STUDIO/ARCHIVE
