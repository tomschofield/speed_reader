‘M.G.’ I WAS FORTUNATE TO SEE THE TALK YOU GAVE ON A CRACK IN THE LIGHT AT THE TORQUE SYMPOSIUM AT FACT AS WELL AS AN INTRODUCTION TO BLISS FOR TWO VOICES AND CHORUS AT TATE LIVERPOOL. IT STRUCK ME THAT ALTHOUGH THEY WERE QUITE DIFFERENT WORKS, THERE WERE CERTAIN LEVELS OF INTER-TEXTUALITY AT PLAY IN TERMS OF NEGOTIATING LANGUAGE, THE MEDIATION OF THOUGHT, SPEECH AND’ THE HEARD’. ARE THE PIECES COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW OR IS THERE A SENSE OF A SHARED ENQUIRY IN BOTH WORKS? -- I REALLY ENJOYED THE WAYS IN WHICH YOU WERE ABLE TO UTILISE THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP WITH AUDITORY SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY, THE READING A LUMP PRISON BREAD TRAVERSING BORDERS FROM A MOSCOW PRISON AND THE MYSTICAL L NATURE OF RAINER MARIA RILKE’S POETRY. THERE APPEARS TO BE A NOTION OF TRAVELLING IN A LITERAL SENSE BUT ALSO IN A VERY METAPHYSICAL SENSE WHERE IDEAS OF TRANSLATION, MEDIATION AND TECHNOLOGY SHIFT LANGUAGE AND TEXTUAL PRACTICES IN TERMS OF READERSHIP. I SENSED THAT THE PROCESS INVOLVED COULD EITHER BE QUITE ORGANIC AND ACCIDENTAL OR VERY METICULOUS AND PREPARED. COULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR PROCESS IN TERMS OF DECISION MAKING? WHAT DRIVES A CRACK IN THE LIGHT IN TERMS OF THE VARIOUS AESTHETIC CHOICES YOU’VE MADE? -- THE INTERWEAVING OF VOICES IN AN INTRODUCTION TO BLISS FOR TWO VOICES AND CHORUS REALLY INTERESTED ME IN TERMS OF HOW THEY DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF LANGUAGE AND HOW THE VOICE CAN BE ISOLATED AND PRESENTED AS SONIC AND LINGUISTIC MATERIAL WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF EVERYDAY DAY CONVERSATION. IT SEEMED APPROPRIATE THAT THE WORK WAS PRESENTED AS PART OF THE BIENNIAL’S THINKING CITY PROGRAMME CONSIDERING THE WAYS IN WHICH WE NEGOTIATE COMMUNICATION AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF OVERHEARD SPEECH, AUTHORITARIAN COMMANDS, ADVERTISING AND TECHNOLOGY. IN RETROSPECT, HOW HAS THE WORK ENABLED YOU TO REFLECT ON THE NATURE OF DIALOGICAL DISCOURSE? -- IS THERE IS A RADICAL, POLITICAL INTENT IN YOUR WORK? IT SEEMS TO ME THAT EXPERIMENTAL LANGUAGE PRACTICES THAT FOCUS ON COMMUNICATION DIFFICULTIES, I.E. TONY O’DONNELL’S DEVELOPMENT OF AN ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE SYSTEM, HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DISRUPT AND EXPOSE A KIND OF COMMODITY FETISHISM, WHERE THE FUNCTION OF LANGUAGE IS TIED TO A CAPITALIST SOCIAL ORDER. IS THERE A SENSE THAT YOUR PRACTICE MIGHT BE ATTEMPTING A REPOSSESS LANGUAGE BY REVEALING ITS IDIOSYNCRATIC NATURE? THIS SEEMS ESPECIALLY RELEVANT TO A CRACK IN THE LIGHT WHERE THE SURVEILLANCE OF LANGUAGE IS USED A POWERFUL POLITICAL TOOL. -- ‘I.S.’ THE TWO WORKS FOLLOWED ON ONE FROM THE OTHER, THEY DRAW ON DIFFERENT STREAMS OF THOUGHT BUT ARE EACH PART OF A BROADER CURRENT OF IDEAS AND QUESTIONS AROUND THE FORMATION OF SUBJECTIVE AND SOCIAL SPACE, THROUGH THE PRISM OF THE VOICE – THAT IS THE BROADER ENQUIRY THAT I AM FOCUSING ON IN THE LONGER TERM. I MADE A CRACK IN THE LIGHT DURING 2013, IT WAS TRIGGERED BY TWO FIGURES, ONE FICTIONAL AND THE OTHER ACTUAL. EACH OF THEM ARE PREOCCUPIED BY THE IDEA OF READING THE VOICE, WITH A SUBTEXT OF THE EXERCISING OF A REGIME OF POWER OVER THE SUBJECT THROUGH TECHNOLOGY, AND SURVEILLANCE IN PARTICULAR. IN BOTH FIGURES THERE IS A TENSION BETWEEN THE DESIRE TO FRAME AND DEFINE THE SUBJECT, TO IDENTIFY AND FIX THEM, THROUGH AN OPERATION UPON THE VOICE AND UPON LANGUAGE – AND ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE IS AN ESCAPE FROM OR AN IMPOSSIBILITY TO DESIGNATE, TO DEFINE OR TO CONTAIN THE SUBJECT THROUGH LANGUAGE. AN INTRODUCTION TO BLISS... COMES OUT OF QUESTIONS WHICH HAVE CONTINUED TO INTEREST FOR ME SINCE I WORKED WITH TONY O’DONNELL, A MAN WHO HAS APHASIA DUE TO A STROKE, IN 2003. HIS RELATIONSHIP TO LANGUAGE HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION, ALTHOUGH HE SPEAKS FLUENTLY, THERE HAS BEEN A DISTURBANCE TO THE LANGUAGE CORTEX OF THE BRAIN. TONY KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS TO SAY AND UNDERSTANDS WHAT IS SAID TO HIM, BUT OFTEN FINDS IT HARD TO FIND HIS WORDS AND FORM STANDARD SYNTAX. WHEN HE CANNOT GRASP A WORD HE WANTS TO USE, HE HAS TO TRANSLATE, TO FINDING A SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATIVE, AND THE MEANINGS OF WORDS AND OUR PROCESSES OF UNDERSTANDING ARE STRETCHED AND RECONFIGURED. THE PERFORMANCE IS BASED ON AN IMPROVISED CONVERSATION BETWEEN TONY AND SPEECH THERAPIST JUDITH LANGLEY, IN WHICH ESSENTIALLY THEY ARE DISCUSSING WHETHER THERE CAN BE SUCH AS THING AS A PURELY VISUAL LANGUAGE IN THE ABSENCE OF SPOKEN OR WRITTEN LANGUAGE. THE DISCUSSION IS KEY TO TONY’S ONGOING PROJECT OF MANY YEARS, TO DEVELOP A GRAMMATICAL SYSTEM FOR THE WIDELY ESTABLISHED PICTOGRAPHIC LANGUAGE BLISS, WHICH IS USED BY PEOPLE WITH COMMUNICATION DIFFICULTIES. JUDITH AND TONY HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING AND ARGUING RELATED IDEAS AROUND THE QUESTION FOR YEARS, THE INTIMACY AND UNDERSTANDING AND THE SONIC QUALITY OF THEIR VOICES MAKES THIS A KIND OF INTERIOR DIALOGUE. THEIR CONVERSATION IS RELAYED BY TWO CHORUS GROUPS WHO, LIKE THE CLASSICAL GREEK CHORUS, TRANSMIT, INTERPRET AND REPEAT IDEAS FROM THE MAIN ‘NARRATIVE’ – I HAD THE IMAGE OF A TRANSMISSION AND TRANSLATION OF MEANINGS, FROM A SPACE OF INTERIOR THOUGHT, WHERE IDEAS ARE IN CONSTANT NEGOTIATION WITH WORDS, TO FULLY FORMED AND ARTICULATED SPEECH ADDRESSED OUTWARDLY. DUE TO TONY’S LANGUAGE THIS MAIN NARRATIVE IS VERY PRECISE AND SEARCHING AND AT THE SAME TIME ELUSIVE, FLOATING AND AT TIMES UNGRASPABLE, AND THIS FORCES A CONTINUOUS NEGOTIATION ON THE PART OF THE VIEWER/ LISTENER. THIS ECHOES THAT TENSION I DESCRIBED ABOVE, BETWEEN DESIRE AND MECHANISMS BEHIND THE DRIVE FOR DEFINITION, COUNTER DESIRES, AND A REFLECTION ON WHAT IS THAT SPACE OF NON-UNDERSTANDING THAT CAN BE EXPERIENCED AS DISTURBING. THIS IS PROBABLY THE LEVEL ON WHICH THE TWO WORKS ARE MOST CONNECTED, AND IT’S ABOUT A CONDITION OF RELATIONSHIP RATHER THAN A THEMATIC OR CONCEPTUAL LINK. GOING BACK TO THE TWO FIGURES BEHIND A CRACK IN THE LIGHT THAT I MENTIONED ABOVE, ONE OF THESE WAS SACHA VAN LOO, A WIRETAP ANALYST WHO WORKS FOR ANTWERP CENTRAL POLICE. I CONTACTED HIM IN 2008 AFTER COMING ACROSS A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE ABOUT HIM, HE WAS ONE OF THIRTY BLIND PEOPLE RECRUITED QUITE RANDOMLY BY THE POLICE FOR THIS WORK, BUT HAPPENED ALSO TO HAVE EXTRAORDINARY KNOWLEDGE OF LANGUAGE AND DIALECTS, AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF SPACE THROUGH ECHOLOCATION. OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS I DEVELOPED THE OUTLINE OF WHAT BECAME AN INSTALLATION IN 2011 AT MATTS GALLERY LONDON, BUT THERE WERE IDEAS RELATED TO HIS BIOGRAPHY AND PERCEPTION WHICH I COULDN’T ADDRESS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THAT PIECE AND THEY BECAME THE STARTING POINT FOR ‘A CRACK IN THE LIGHT’ TWO YEARS LATER. ALTHOUGH IN THE END SACHA HIMSELF ISN’T IN THE WORK, WHAT IS CARRIED OVER IS THE MAPPING OF A THRESHOLD OF LANGUAGE EVOKED IN THAT SPACE OF TENSION THAT I DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE OTHER FIGURE IS THE NOVEL ‘IN THE FIRST CIRCLE’, BY ALEXANDER SOLZHENITSYN (1968), WHICH INTERTWINES MINUTELY OBSERVED REALITIES OF THE AUTHOR’S PERSONAL EXPERIENCES, AND IMAGINED NARRATIVES. IT CENTRES ON MAVRINO SPECIAL PRISON IN MOSCOW SOME TIME IN THE 1950’S, WHERE THE MAIN CHARACTERS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FROM THE GULAGS TO WORK ON SECRET RESEARCH FOR STALIN: TWO VOICE-RELATED TECHNOLOGIES, A VOICE- PRINTING MACHINE TO CONCLUSIVELY IDENTIFY SUSPECTS USING PAPER PRINT-OUTS MADE FROM KGB WIRETAP RECORDINGS, AND A VOICE SCRAMBLER TO MANGLE SPEECH ON STALIN’S PRIVATE PHONE LINE, PROTECTING HIS WORDS FROM EAVESDROPPERS BY TURNING THEM INTO NONSENSE. (SOLZHENITSYN EXPERIENCED AN ALMOST IDENTICAL SCENARIO IN MARFINO PRISON MOSCOW, FROM 1948-1950, WHERE, WITH HIS EXTRAORDINARY MEMORY AND FASCINATION FOR TECHNOLOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE, HE CARRIED OUT PIONEERING WORK ON THE VOCODER). I DISCOVERED AND READ THE NOVEL AFTER MAKING THE INSTALLATION WITH SACHA VAN LOO IN 2011, AS THERE WERE MANY CONNECTIONS IN THIS FICTIONAL STORY WITH SACHA’S ACTUAL BIOGRAPHY - TOO MUCH TO GO INTO HERE, BUT THEY WERE GRIPPING FOR ME, AS I SEARCHED FOR A WAY TO FRAME THOSE UNADDRESSED ASPECTS I MENTIONED, AND THE WORK I WANTED TO MAKE. FROM THIS NOVEL, I SET UP A NUMBER OF MEETINGS IN MOSCOW, WHICH WERE TO PRODUCE THE MATERIAL FOR THE INSTALLATION - WITH SOLZHENITSYN’S WIDOW, NATALYA; WITH THE ACTOR ALEXEI KOLUBKOV, WHO PLAYED A KEY CHARACTER IN THE RUSSIAN TV ADAPTATION OF THE NOVEL, AND FINALLY WITH THE PIECE OF BREAD YOU MENTION, WHICH I HAD 3D LASER-SCANNED AT CYBERCOM IN MOSCOW. THE BREAD WAS IN A SENSE THE MAIN PROTAGONIST IN THIS WORK. I SAW IT IN 2011 AFTER FINISHING THE WORK WITH SACHA, IN AN EXHIBITION IN GENEVA - I WAS RESEARCHING A GROUP EXHIBITION I WAS CURATING FOR FUNDACIO ANTONI TAPIES IN BARCELONA, ‘IN THE FIRST CIRCLE’ (2011-12). THERE IN A VITRINE WAS A SMALL, BROWN, NON-DESCRIPT LUMP, A TINY SCULPTURE. THE LABEL INFORMED THAT THE BREAD WAS PART OF A MEAL THAT SOLZHENITSYN HAD SAVED FROM A SOVIET PRISON, PUT IN HIS POCKET AND KEPT FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. I WAS SURE HE WAS GIVEN IT AT MARFINO PRISON, AND THAT IT WAS INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO HIS NOVEL AND THE FICTIONAL MAVRINO. THE MEMORY OF THE BREAD STAYED WITH ME AS THE MOST CHARGED PIECE OF ANONYMOUS- LOOKING DULL-BROWN MATERIAL ONE COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE; A MATERIAL TRACE OF A WEB OF BIOGRAPHICAL, HISTORICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE IMPRESSION OF SOLZHENITSYN’S TEETH WHERE THEY HAD BITTEN INTO IT AND THEN RELEASED, WHEN HIS MEAL WAS INTERRUPTED. TWO YEARS AFTER SEEING THE BREAD, I WAS INVITED TO MAKE A NEW WORK FOR BERGEN TRIENNALE. THE CURATOR’S MAIN REFERENCE FOR THEIR EXHIBITION WAS A NOVEL BY THE STRUGATSKY BROTHERS, THEIR SCIENCE- FICTION NOVEL ‘MONDAY BEGINS ON SATURDAY’, A MAGICAL-REALIST CRITIQUE OF THE SOVIET SYSTEM, THROUGH THE IMAGE OF THEIR TECHNOLOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INSTITUTES. THE CURATORS TOOK THIS BOOK AS A TOOL FOR REFLECTING ON THE IDEOLOGICAL SHIFTS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE THE END OF THE COLD WAR AND THE BEGINNING OF POST-SOVIET, POST-CAPITALIST TIMES. WITH THIS INVITATION, MY ACCUMULATION OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS FOUND A DIRECTION AND A WORK COULD BE DEVELOPED. THE BREAD BECAME THE CORE OF A NUMBER OF INTERRELATED IMAGES AND NARRATIVES WHICH ARE BOTH FICTIONAL AND DOCUMENTARY. ALL THIS IS TO DESCRIBE HOW MY DECISIONS CAN DEVELOP FROM THE SEED OF A STRONG IMAGE, THROUGH A SERIES OF DIFFERENT ACCUMULATING MOMENTS, INTUITIVE AND IMPULSIVE ATTRACTIONS, MATERIAL RESEARCH AND THINKING RESEARCH, CONCEPTUAL CONCEITS, ACCIDENTAL DISCOVERIES. YOU MENTION THE TITLE ‘A CRACK IN THE LIGHT’, IT REFERS TO A POEM BY RILKE ABOUT A BLIND MAN WALKING ALONG THE PAVEMENT ‘LIKE A DARK CRACK IN THE LIGHT’. A POETIC IMAGE FOR BLINDNESS BUT ALSO FOR THE UNSEEABLE, THE UNMAPPABLE; AN ATTEMPT TO EVOKE THE IMAGE AS IT MIGHT BE BEYOND THE RETINAL. THE DARK CRACK IS DARK ONLY FOR THE SIGHTED PERSON, WHO IS UNABLE TO IMAGINE WHAT IT IS TO PERCEIVE FROM WITHIN THE CRACK. THERE’S A CORRELATION HERE WITH OUR RELATION TO LANGUAGE: IF YOU ARE IN LANGUAGE YOU CANNOT POSSIBLY THINK OR IMAGINE YOURSELF OUT OF IT. TONY O’DONNELL LOST LANGUAGE FOR A WHOLE YEAR AND IS STILL SOMEHOW ON THE THRESHOLD OF LANGUAGE, AND WE CANNOT EXPERIENCE HOW THINKING, WORDS AND MEANINGS ARE EXPERIENCED FROM THAT SPACE - BUT IN LISTENING TO HIM WE DO EXPERIENCE THE EFFECT OF HIS LANGUAGE ON OURS; IT CANNOT REMAIN FULLY INTACT, WE FIND OURSELVES REDISCOVERING THINGS ABOUT HOW WE UNDERSTAND SPEECH AND HOW WE UNDERSTAND THE OTHER. PAUL RICŒUR WRITES THAT YOU CANNOT LEARN THE LANGUAGE OF THE OTHER WITHOUT LETTING GO OF YOUR OWN LANGUAGE. THIS CAN BE ALARMING AND EVEN FRIGHTENING. LETTING GO OF THE SECURITY OF KNOWN POINTS OF REFERENCE, IDENTIFIABLE MARKERS, COMMONLY USED GRAMMAR, GIVEN ‘KNOWLEDGE’. THAT’S PART OF WHAT MY WORK IS TRYING TO DO, AND IT’S ALSO PART OF THE PROCESS OF MAKING IT, A CONDITION OF THE DIALOGUES THROUGH WHICH I DEVELOP IT. 187 VIDEO STILLS FROM: A CRACK IN THE LIGHT, 2013.
