LIVE CODING IS WHERE SOMEONE CHANGES A COMPUTER PROGRAM TO RESPOND TO THE PRESENT MOMENT, FOR EXAMPLE TO MAKE LIVE MUSIC OR VIDEO FOR AN AUDIENCE, OR JUST FOR THEMSELVES. LIVE CODERS WORK ON THE SYMBOLIC LEVEL, MANIPULATING THE (USUALLY) TEXTUAL SOURCE CODE THAT UNDERLIES ALL SOFTWARE, WHILE A LIVE COMPUTER PROCESS IS RUNNING. IN OTHER WORDS, RATHER THAN USING A DESIGNED END-USER INTERFACE TO CREATE SOMETHING, LIVE CODERS DIRECTLY USE A LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE SOMETHING, WHILE A COMPUTER WORKS TO GENERATE IT INTO EXISTENCE. FORMAL LANGUAGE IS BROUGHT TO LIFE, FORMING PART OF AN EXPLORATION WITH NO END PRODUCT, BEYOND LIVE EXPERIENCE. LIVE CODING CULTURE PROPOSES AN ALTERNATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH COMPUTATION. ACCORDING TO ROB MYERS (2010), LIVE CODING OFFERS THE CHANCE “... TO EXPERIENCE THROUGH AN UNUSUAL AESTHETIC EVENT WHAT HACKERS ARE MISSING IN SOCIETY AND WHAT SOCIETY IS MISSING IN HACKING.” WHAT COULD BE MISSING? COMMENTATORS SOMETIMES DESCRIBE LIVE CODING AS A GLORIFICATION OF TECHNOLOGY, OR A CELEBRATION OF VIRTUOSO SKILL, BUT TO ME IT IS MUCH LESS THAN THAT: AN UNRAVELLING OF TECHNOLOGY, AND A SHOW OF HONESTY. BY USING CODE AS PRIMARY INTERFACE, LIVE CODERS SIDESTEP A WHOLE INDUSTRY OF QUALITY CONTROLLED DESIGN STANDARDS. RATHER THAN BUTTONS, SLIDERS AND BOXES, THEY SIMPLY USE WORDS. BY UNRAVELLING TECHNOLOGY PERHAPS WE CAN FIND A MORE HUMAN APPROACH TO COMPUTER LANGUAGE. SO, ON ONE SIDE, SOCIETY COULD BE MISSING A HACKERLY VIEW OF EVERYDAY COMPUTERS AS MACHINES FOR BRINGING LANGUAGE TO LIFE. BUT WHAT ARE HACKERS MISSING FROM SOCIETY? THROUGH HONEST DEMONSTRATION OF THEIR CRAFT, PERHAPS WHAT THEY HAVE TO GAIN IS A DEMYSTIFICATION OF WHAT THEY DO, AND A RECONNECTION WITH SOCIETY. DUE TO THE GENERATIVITY OF LANGUAGE, THE QUANTITY AND COMPLEXITY OF CODE NEEDED TO GENERATE MUSIC OR VIDEO IS LOW. BY EXPERIENCING THE PRODUCTION OF CODE AS HUMAN ACTIVITY, WE CAN ESCAPE THE USUAL ANXIETIES SURROUNDING MATHEMATICAL OR LINGUISTIC ABSTRACTIONS. FURTHERMORE, BY MAKING THE PRODUCTION OF CODE VISIBLE, SOCIETY CAN THEN BEGIN TO FIND CULTURAL MEANING FOR IT. AS INGOLD (2011) PUTS IT, “THE ESSENCE OF SKILL, THEN, COMES TO LIE IN THE IMPROVISATIONAL ABILITY WITH WHICH PRACTITIONERS ARE ABLE TO DISASSEMBLE THE CONSTRUCTIONS OF TECHNOLOGY, AND CREATIVELY TO REINCORPORATE THE PIECES INTO THEIR OWN WALKS OF LIFE.” BY BREAKING DOWN THE BARRIER BETWEEN HACKERS AND THE REST OF SOCIETY, WE ARE ABLE TO ENRICH OUR LIVES WITH NEW SKILLS AND MEANING. PERHAPS ON THIS BASIS, HACKERLY IDEALS OF SOFTWARE FREEDOM CAN BEGIN TO BE COMMUNICATED MORE WIDELY. WE NOW ARRIVE AT THE TEXTILE METAPHOR AT THE HEART OF THIS ESSAY: THE WEAVING OF CODE INTO LIFE. LIVE CODER DAVE GRIFFITHS HAS LONG EXPLORED CONNECTIONS BETWEEN CODE AND WEAVES INCLUDING IN WORKSHOPS, AND I HAVE COMPARED PATTERNS OF LIVE CODE WITH KNITTING (MCLEAN 2013). EMMA COCKER (2014), THROUGH IN-DEPTH OBSERVATIONS OF LIVE CODERS AND LIVE ARTISTS TALKING AND WORKING TOGETHER, NOTED THAT “LIKE PENELOPE’S WEAVE, [LIVE] CODE HAS THE CAPACITY TO BE UNRAVELLED AND REWRITTEN AS EVENTS UNFOLD, [REVEALING] THE RULES OR CODES EVEN AS THEY ARE BEING AMENDED ...”. COCKER IDENTIFIES LIVE CODING AS A KAIROTIC PRACTICE, A REFERENCE TO PASSING A WEFT THREAD THROUGH THE MOMENTARY SHED OF A LOOM; EXISTING IN TIME, AND FORMULATING AND RESPONDING TO A NEW SITUATION AS IT UNFOLDS. HER REFERENCE TO PENELOPE IS TO THE MYTHOLOGICAL WEAVER, WEAVING BY DAY AND UNRAVELLING BY NIGHT. IN HIS PAPER THE TEXTILITY OF MAKING, INGOLD (2010) DRAWS FROM THE VERY MATERIAL OF TEXTILES TO ARGUE THAT “THE FORMS OF THINGS ARISE WITHIN FIELDS OF FORCE AND FLOWS OF MATERIAL. IT IS BY INTERVENING IN THESE FORCE-FIELDS AND FOLLOWING THE LINES OF FLOW THAT PRACTITIONERS MAKE THINGS.’’ THE WAYS IN WHICH WE MAY USE COMPUTERS WITHOUT A PLAN, OR USING A PLAN ONLY AS RESOURCE RATHER THAN PRESCRIPTION FOR ACTION, ARE WELL EXPLORED BY ETHNOGRAPHERS, AND MODERN PROGRAMMERS RECOGNISE AGILE APPROACHES TO PROBLEM SPECIFICATION. SOME LIVE CODERS, INCLUDING THOSE DRAWING FROM THE “FREE IMPROV” MUSIC TRADITION, TAKE THIS TO AN EXTREME, IMPROVISING MUSIC FROM NOTHING. IDEAS FLOW AND RESPOND TO AND FROM THE SITUATION AS IT UNFOLDS. RATHER THAN WRITING CODE TO COMMUNICATE A MUSICAL IDEA, THE CODE IS AN INTERMEDIARY MATERIAL, WHICH THE CODER RESPONDS TO AS WELL AS THE SOUND OR VIDEO THAT THE DESCRIBED PROCESS PRODUCES. CODE IS A PATTERN THAT CREATES PATTERN. THIS IS TRUE OF KNITTING PATTERNS, AND ALSO WEAVING BLOCK DESIGNS. PATTERNS IN THE DOMAIN OF THREADS, NEEDLES, AND SHEDS GENERATE PATTERNS IN FABRIC, AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO DOMAINS OF NOTATION AND TEXTILE RESULT CAN BE FAR FROM CLEAR. INDEED, ELLEN HARLIZIUS-KLÜCK (2008) HAS TRACED THE ORIGINS OF DISCRETE MATHEMATICS (AND THEREFORE COMPUTATION AS WE KNOW IT) TO ANCIENT LOOMS, FOR EXAMPLE PYTHAGORAS DEVELOPING DYADIC MATHEMATICS USING PRINCIPLES BASED ON ODD AND EVEN THREADS. HARLIZIUS-KLÜCK NOW WISHES TO FIND WAYS TO EXPOSE THE THOUGHT PROCESSES OF ANCIENT WEAVERS IN MUCH THE SAME WAY AS LIVE CODERS SEEK TO EXPOSE AND SHARE THEIR PROCESSES; SHIFTING FOCUS FROM THE MACHINERY OF LOOMS TO THE COMPUTATION INVOLVED IN OPERATING LOOMS. AT THIS POINT, THE CONNECTION BETWEEN COMPUTATION AND TEXTILE CEASES TO BE METAPHORICAL, AND BECOMES ACTUAL. WE FIND OURSELVES UNDERSTANDING OURSELVES NOT BY TALKING ABOUT MATERIAL, BUT DEALING WITH THE TEXTILITY OF MATERIAL ITSELF. THIS ESSAY PRECEDES THE PROJECT “WEAVING CODES, CODING WEAVES” (WWW.KAIROTIC.ORG) FUNDED BY THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES RESEARCH COUNCIL. REFERENCES COCKER, EMMA. 2014.
