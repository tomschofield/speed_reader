HOW HAPPY A THING CAN BE’ IS A NEW TWO-PART WORK THAT INCORPORATES BOTH SCULPTURAL AND VIDEO ELEMENTS. HOW HAPPY FEATURES THREE PERSONAL EFFECTS, MUNDANE PERSONAL ITEMS - A COMB, A SCREWDRIVER, AND A PAIR OF SCISSORS - MODES OF TECHNOLOGY WITH RELATIVE IMMUNITY TO UPDATES AND UPGRADES. THESE OBJECTS, 3D PRINTED FROM DIGITAL MODELS, ARE SET WITHIN THE MOVING BACKDROP OF A SCREEN DEPICTING MOVING MIS-EN-SCENES THAT ALLUDE TO AN ALTERNATE LOCATION FOR THESE OBJECTS. THE HANDHELD DEVICES CO-EXIST IN A CORRESPONDING VIDEO WORK IN WHICH THEIR DIGITAL FORMS PERFORM A CHOREOGRAPHED ARCH THAT IMPLIES THEY ARE BEING PUSHED TO THEIR LIMITS. INSPIRED BY TABLOID BREAKDOWNS AND MEDIATIZED DISASTERS, THE OBJECTS’ PATHS EXPLORE THE TRANSIENT EXCHANGE OF SPIRIT, IN BOTH THE HUMAN CONDITION AND OUR APPARATUSES, ENDOWED THROUGH THE INCREASINGLY OVERWHELMING THRUST FOR SOMETHING MORE. THEIR PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL ITERATIONS ARE IDENTICAL, ALLOWING A STATE THAT IS AT ONCE VERITABLE AND INDESCRIBABLE, CAUGHT UP SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE BLURRING THE SENTIMENTAL AND THE ANTICLIMACTIC.
