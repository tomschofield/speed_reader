THIS WRITING EXPLORES THE INTERSECTIONS OF CHOREOGRAPHY AND COMPUTER PROGRAMMING. IT ACKNOWLEDGES CODING AS A CHOREOGRAPHIC PRACTICE, AS WELL AS APPLIES COMPUTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND APPROACHES TO LIVE DANCE PERFORMANCE. BY EXPLORING EMERGING DEFINITIONS OF CHOREOGRAPHY, APPLYING COMPUTATIONAL ASPECTS TO CHOREOGRAPHY AND DISCUSSING THE NOTION OF PROGRAMMER AS CHOREOGRAPHER, A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF CODE AND CHOREOGRAPHY WITHIN THIS AUTHOR’S WORK IS PRESENTED. THIS IS ILLUSTRATED IN THE WORK SOUND CHOREOGRAPHER <> BODY CODE, CO-CREATED WITH ALEX MCLEAN. EXPANDING DEFINITIONS OF CHOREOGRAPHY DEFINITIONS OF CHOREOGRAPHY HAVE EXPANDED THROUGHOUT THE 20TH AND 21ST CENTURY. CHOREOLOGIST RUDOLPH LABAN (1960) ESTABLISHED MANY WAYS TO DISCUSS CHOREOGRAPHY, RANGING FROM CHOREUTICS (SPATIAL PRINCIPLES) TO KINETOGRAPHY (NOTATION). HOWEVER, THE HUMAN BODY WAS ALWAYS CENTRAL TO HIS APPROACH TO CHOREOGRAPHY. EXPANDING ON HIS WORKS WERE PRESTON-DUNLOP AND SANCHEZ-COLBERG (2002) WHO ESTABLISHED CHOREOGRAPHY AS THE “NEXUS OF THE STRANDS OF THE DANCE MEDIUM”. THE KEY TO THEIR WORK IS THAT CHOREOGRAPHY BECOMES AN INTERRELATION OF MOVEMENT, SPACE, SOUND AND PERFORMER. THIS INTERRELATION WITHIN THE NEXUS POINTS TO CHOREOGRAPHY AS AN ORGANISATION OR COMPOSITION, RATHER THAN JUST A PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OF THE BODY. IN FACT WITH THE FOUR META-TERMS (THERE ARE ALSO SUB- CATEGORIES TO THE STRANDS IN THE NEXUS) CHOREOGRAPHY MAY START TO CONSIDER WORK OUTSIDE OF THE BODY. THIS SHIFT AWAY FROM LABAN’S PRACTICES HAS ALLOWED FOR MORE RECENT DISCOURSE WITHIN CHOREOGRAPHY. WILLIAM FORSYTHE (2009), SIOBHAN DAVIES (2011) AND MARTEN SPANGBERG (2011) HAVE ALL DISCUSSED DANCE AND CHOREOGRAPHY AS SEPARATE PRACTICES. WHILE DANCE IS SOMETHING DONE SPECIFICALLY BY THE BODY, OTHER MODES OF CHOREOGRAPHY MAY BE CONSIDERED. A CONCEPT THAT EXPLORES CHOREOGRAPHY BEYOND THE BODY IS FORSYTHE’S CHOREOGRAPHIC OBJECT. A CHOREOGRAPHIC OBJECT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE BODY, BUT RATHER AN ALTERNATIVE SITE FOR THE UNDERSTANDING OF POTENTIAL INSTIGATION AND ORGANIZATION OF ACTION TO RESIDE. IDEALLY, CHOREOGRAPHIC IDEAS IN THIS FORM WOULD DRAW AN ATTENTIVE, DIVERSE READERSHIP THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY UNDERSTAND AND, HOPEFULLY, CHAMPION THE INNUMERABLE MANIFESTATIONS, OLD AND NEW, OF CHOREOGRAPHIC THINKING (FORSYTHE 2009). WITHIN HIS DEFINITION OF A CHOREOGRAPHIC OBJECT, FORSYTHE MAKES SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO INSTIGATION, ACTION AND ORGANISATION. THESE CHARACTERISTICS MAY BE APPLIED TO OTHER DISCIPLINES, SUCH AS COMPUTER PROGRAMMING, TO BEGIN TO EXPAND CHOREOGRAPHY INTO WAYS TO DEFINE PRACTICES THAT INCORPORATE CONCEPTS SUCH AS MOVEMENT, RELATIONSHIPS AND COMPOSITION. ONCE DANCE IS SEPARATED FROM CHOREOGRAPHY, CHOREOGRAPHY CAN DO MANY THINGS. ONE EXAMPLE MAY BE THAT IT CAN BECOME NON-EUCLIDEAN AS IN CHOREOTOPOLOGY (SICCHIO 2011). BUT ALSO THE ORGANISATIONAL AND RELATIVE COMPOSITIONAL ELEMENTS MAY BE APPLIED TO OTHER DISCIPLINES. IN FORSYTHE’S PROJECTS THIS HAS RANGED FROM COMPUTER ANIMATION TO FURNITURE DESIGN AND IN DAVIES’ WORK CERAMICS AND CRAFTS. SPANGBERG CREATED A BLOG AND A BOOK AS A CHOREOGRAPHY. THE AREA THIS PAPER WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON IS COMPUTER PROGRAMMING – NOT ONLY HOW ONE MAY CHOREOGRAPH CODE, BUT ALSO HOW CODING MAY BE APPLIED TO CHOREOGRAPHY. PROGRAMMER AS CHOREOGRAPHER ONCE SEPARATED FROM DANCE, CHOREOGRAPHY TAKES PLACE IN MANY DISCIPLINES AS A PROCESS FOR DECISIONS, PARTICULARLY AROUND INTERRELATIONSHIPS CREATED IN A WORK. WITH THIS AUTHOR’S WORK THIS NOTATION OF CHOREOGRAPHY BEING APPLIED TO THE DISCIPLINE OF SOFTWARE AND COMPUTER PROGRAMMING BECAME APPARENT WHEN CREATING CHOREOGRAPHY WITH REAL- TIME VIDEO SYSTEMS. THE REAL-TIME VIDEO SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED WITH THE USE OF BACKGROUND SUBTRACTION TO ALLOW SOFTWARE TO DETECT MOVEMENT AND THEN CREATE VISUALS THAT WERE PROJECTED INTO A LIVE DANCE PERFORMANCE. WITHIN THE DEVISING OF THIS WORK, IT BECAME APPARENT THAT NOT ONLY WAS THE CHOREOGRAPHY OF THE PHYSICAL SPACE BEING CREATED, BUT ALSO CHOREOGRAPHY WAS HAPPENING IN THE PROGRAMMING. THE MOTION WAS BEING CAPTURED AND THEN REORGANISED. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MOVING PIXELS WERE CREATED AND COMPOSED. CHANGES IN MOVEMENT COULD BE INSTIGATED THROUGH THE CODE. THE PROGRAMMING OF THIS SYSTEM WAS NOT ONLY A TECHNICAL ELEMENT OF A DANCE PIECE, BUT A CHOREOGRAPHED PART OF THE WORK. IN ADDITION TO CONSIDERING PROGRAMMING A CHOREOGRAPHIC PRACTICE, CHOREOGRAPHY CAN BE MADE VIA CODING AND PROGRAMMING APPROACHES. “THE NOTION OF INSTRUCTIONS OR RULE SETTING AS A WAY TO GENERATE DANCE MATERIAL, IS SIMILAR TO RULES AND INSTRUCTIONS, CALLED ALGORITHMS” (DELAHUNTA 2010, 20). THE USE OF ALGORITHMS WITHIN CHOREOGRAPHY IS FOUND IN WORK BY VARIOUS CHOREOGRAPHERS. DOWNIE (2005) REFERS TO THE “COMPUTATIONAL SENSIBILITIES” OF MERCE CUNNINGHAM, TRISHA BROWN, BILL T. JONES AND FORTHSYE AND DISCUSSES HOW HE FINDS THEIR WORK SIMILAR TO THAT OF COMPUTING THROUGH SYSTEMS, METHODS AND NOTATION OF THE CREATION OF THE CHOREOGRAPHY AND WITHIN PERFORMANCE. THE PERFORMANCE OF CODE IN CHOREOGRAPHY IS LESS DEVELOPED THAN JUST THOSE USING COMPUTATION IDEAS WITHIN THEIR CHOREOGRAPHIC STRATEGIES. “THE EXTENT TO WHICH LIVE SYSTEMS REWRITING HAS BEEN A CENTRAL FEATURE OF CHOREOGRAPHIC WORK IN CONTEMPORARY DANCE IS ARGUABLE, BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOME ANALOGOUS STRUCTURES AND DEVICES” (COLLINS 2011, 2). THERE ARE HOWEVER, SOME EXAMPLES SUCH AS THE PIECE DUPLEX (2002) WHICH CUED DANCERS VIA MONITORS IN REAL-TIME OR ALIE/N A(C)TION (1992) WHICH SIMILARLY USED VIDEO CLIPS TO GIVE DANCERS DIRECTIONS LIVE IN PERFORMANCE. WITHIN THIS AUTHOR’S WORK, OTHER WAYS IN WHICH LIVE STRUCTURES AND CHANGES CAN BE MADE IN PERFORMANCE, AS WELL AS REFLECT CHOREOGRAPHY IN MORE COMPUTATIONAL FORMATS. SOUND CHOREOGRAPHER < > BODY CODE IS A PIECE WHICH EXPLORES A COMPUTER GENERATED CODE- SCORE THAT IS DEVELOPED, INTERPRETED AND PERFORMED LIVE AND FEEDS BACK INTO A LIVE CODED SOUND SCORE. SOUND CHOREOGRAPHER <> BODY CODE IN SOUND CHOREOGRAPHER < > BODY CODE, DIAGRAMMATIC SCORES THAT ARE GENERATED BY CODE HAVE BECOME THE SOURCE FOR PERFORMANCE AND DETERMINED THE CHOREOGRAPHY. THIS IS DEMONSTRATED IN THE PIECE SOUND CHOREOGRAPHER < > BODY CODE. WITHIN THIS WORK THERE ARE TWO PERFORMERS WITH CHANGING CODE-SCORES WITH ONE CHOREOGRAPHIC SCORE AND THE OTHER A LIVE CODED SOUND SCORE. TO ACHIEVE CONFLUENCE FROM THESE TWO PRACTICES, A CONNECTION OF AESTHETIC AND TECHNICAL ASPECTS ON BOTH SIDES, AND A BALANCE BETWEEN THEM WAS NEEDED. THE SOLUTION WE ARRIVED AT MAINTAINS A CLEAR DISTINCTION CHOREOGRAPHY/DANCE ON ONE SIDE, AND CODE/MUSIC, BUT CONNECTS THEM VIA THEIR NOTATIONS. AS A RESULT THE MUSIC IS NOT CODED FOR THE DANCER, AND THE DANCER DOES NOT MOVE TO THE MUSIC; BUT STILL A FEEDBACK LOOP IS CREATED THAT PASSES THROUGH THE BODY AND CODE, VIA MACHINE LISTENING AND COMPUTER VISION. THE DANCER HAS A SET SERIES OF GESTURES THAT ARE ORGANISED AND PERFORMED BASED UPON HOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AND NUMBERS ARE CONNECTED AND CONTINUALLY RECONFIGURED WITHIN A VISUAL SCORE THAT IS PROJECTED INTO THE PERFORMANCE SPACE. HOWEVER, AS THE PERFORMANCE PROGRESSES, THE DIAGRAM BECOMES MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND THE SPANNING TREE IS RECALCULATED. THE NUMBER OF INSTRUCTIONS INCREASES OVER TIME ON A SET INCREMENTAL PATTERN THAT PEAKS AT A POINT OF COMPLETE OVERWHELM FOR THE DANCER AND RETURNS BACK TO THE SIMPLER FORM TO END THE PERFORMANCE. THE RECONFIGURATIONS IN THE DANCE SCORE ARE NOT ONLY GENERATED BY TIME, BUT ALSO THE COMPUTER ANALYSING THE SOUND THAT IS PRODUCED WITHIN THE SOUND SCORE. THE LANGUAGE ALSO PLAYS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS SYSTEM IN THE INSTRUCTION OF HOW THE MOVEMENT CHANGES AND DEVELOPS. THE WORDS WITHIN THE SCORE ARE ABLE TO BE APPLIED TO MOVEMENT AND SOMEHOW CHANGE THE MOVEMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, IN SOUND CHOREOGRAPHER <> BODY CODE THE INSTRUCTIONS INCLUDE “RIGHT”, “LEFT”, “UP”, “DOWN”, “LOOP”, “IF” AND NUMBERS “1”, “2”, AND “3”. THE DANCER MUST DETERMINE HOW THE ORDER AND CONNECTION OF THESE WORDS AND NUMBERS IS THEN ORGANISED WITHIN THE PERFORMANCE. THIS PROCESS HAPPENS LIVE AND IN REAL-TIME. THE SCORE EVOLVES AND CHANGES AND SO DOES THE DANCE THAT IS BEING DEVISED IN FRONT OF THE AUDIENCE. FIG.1. THE SOUND CHOREOGRAPHER, SHOWING INSTRUCTIONS RIGHT, LEFT, UP, DOWN AND NUMBERS, CONNECTED IN A MINIMUM SPANNING TREE. THE LINE EXTENDING FROM THE CENTRAL POINT SWEEPS THROUGH A SINGLE CYCLE DURING THE PERFORMANCE, AND THE TWO BLUE SHAPES SHOW “INTENSITY” AND “CHANGE” GRAPHED OVER TIME. INTENSITY GIVES THE NUMBER OF INSTRUCTIONS, AND CHANGE THE SIZE OF EACH MOVEMENT THAT IS MADE IN RESPONSE TO SOUND ONSETS. WHILE THE GESTURES ARE PREDETERMINED BY THE CHOREOGRAPHER, THE ACTUAL ARRANGEMENT AND CHOREOGRAPHY OF THESE GESTURES IS DETERMINED BY TECHNOLOGY. THE DANCE SCORE BECOMES A FORM OF PROGRAMMING AND THE DANCER THE COMPUTER, TWISTING INTERPRETATIONS OF CONTROL AND PROCEDURE. THE DANCER’S MOVEMENT IS TRACKED BY A MICROSOFT KINECT AND THE SOFTWARE ISADORA TO DETECT THE LOCATION AND SHAPE OF THE BODY IN SPACE. THIS INFORMATION IS THEN SENT VIA OSC TO A CUSTOM LIVE CODING PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT, TEXTURE, WHERE A SPECIALLY CREATED OBJECT IS MOVED WITHIN THE CODE. THIS MOTION TRACKING NOT ONLY HELPS TO FACILITATE THE FEEDBACK LOOP, BUT ALSO PROVIDES ONE OF THE TWO POINTS OF CONTACT BETWEEN THE MOVEMENT AND THE SOUND. SO THE MOVEMENT OF THE DANCER CHANGES THE CODE AND THE SOUND PRODUCED BY THE LIVE CODING CHANGES THE DANCE SCORE. THE MOVEMENT OF THE DANCER TRANSLATES INTO MOVEMENT WITHIN CODE, BECAUSE TEXTURE IS USED. THE SECOND POINT OF CONTACT BETWEEN THE CHOREOGRAPHY AND CODE IS VIA MACHINE LISTENING. THE SOUND CHOREOGRAPHY SOFTWARE PERFORMS AUDIO ONSET DETECTION ON THE SOUND PRODUCED FROM TEXTURE, AND THE WORDS WITHIN THE CHOREOGRAPHY MOVE IN RESPONSE. THIS CAN RESULT IN CONNECTIONS SWITCHING BETWEEN WORDS, WHEN THE MOVEMENT RESULTS IN A DIFFERENT MINIMUM SPANNING TREE. IN THIS SENSE, THE CHOREOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE IS DANCING MORE DIRECTLY TO THE RHYTHM OF THE SOUND THAN THE HUMAN DANCER. WITHIN THIS PIECE, THE TECHNOLOGY HAS BECOME INSTRUMENTAL IN BRINGING THE ELEMENTS TOGETHER. DURING PREVIOUS PERFORMANCES, BOTH PERFORMERS WERE FOCUSED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL SCORES RATHER THAN THE OVERALL COMPOSITION OF THE PIECE, AND ACHIEVING A FEEDBACK LOOP TO CONNECT THE TWO SCORES BECAME MORE DIFFICULT. THE TECHNOLOGY BECOMES THE CHOREOGRAPHER IN THIS SENSE AS IT IS ORGANISING THE INTERACTIONS, RATHER THAN THE PERFORMERS SENSING EACH OTHER IN THAT MOMENT. THE DANCE SCORE THAT IS GENERATED THROUGH THE CODE BECOMES MORE AND MORE COMPLEX OVER TIME. THE COMPUTER IS ABLE TO WRITE A SCORE LIVE, FASTER AND MORE COMPLICATED THAN A HUMAN DANCER CAN PERFORM. BY THE END SECTION OF THIS PIECE, THE DANCER WILL ALWAYS FAIL FOLLOWING THE SCORE AS IT IS WRITTEN. THEY MUST MAKE A DECISION ON HOW TO FOLLOW AND INTERPRET SOME OF IT, BUT COULD NEVER COMPLETE THE ENTIRE SCORE. THIS NOT ONLY SUGGESTS THAT THE HUMAN IS DIFFERENT IN ITS PROCESSING AND PERFORMANCE ABILITIES FROM A COMPUTER, BUT THE HUMAN HAS THE AGENCY TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THE SCORE, AND CAN CONTINUE PERFORMING DESPITE FAILING TO COMPLETE THE SCORE AS CREATED WITHIN THE PERFORMANCE. TORQUE OF CHOREOGRAPHIC CODE WHILE THE CHOREOGRAPHIC OUTPUT OF SOUND CHOREOGRAPHER <> BODY CODE IS STILL MOVEMENT AND DANCE BASED, THE PROCESS OF ORGANISING AND STRUCTURING THE MOVEMENT IS COMPUTATIONAL. THE COMPUTER GENERATES THE SCORE AND THE PROGRAMMER IS ESSENTIAL THE CHOREOGRAPHER, PUTTING THE ELEMENTS INTO THE SYSTEM - A SYSTEM WHICH IS ALSO AUGMENTED BY THE MACHINE LISTENING, AND REFLECTING CHANGES TO THE SOUND OF THE PERFORMANCE. THIS DRAWS ON THE EARLIER DISCUSSIONS OF CHOREOGRAPHY AND CODE AS PRACTICES THAT ARE ABOUT ORGANISATION, RATHER THAN A SPECIFIC BODILY PRACTICE. THE BODY IS ONE POTENTIAL SITE FOR CHOREOGRAPHY. CODE IS ANOTHER SITE. AND PROGRAMMING BECOMES A CHOREOGRAPHIC PRACTICE. WHAT THIS ALLOWS IS THE COMPUTER CODE TO BECOME A FORCE IN THE GENERATION OF CHOREOGRAPHY. HOWEVER, IN SOUND CHOREOGRAPHER < > BODY CODE THE TWISTS COME NOT ONLY THROUGH THE COMPUTER GENERATING MATERIAL, BUT THE TECHNOLOGICAL CONNECTIONS TO THE SOUND SCORE AND ALSO THE FINAL INTERPRETATION BY THE PERFORMER. THE FINAL TWIST IN THE TORQUE IS HOW THE HUMAN PERFORMER RESPONDS TO THE CHOREOGRAPHIC CODE. THE HUMAN BODY HAS A VERY DIFFERENT PROCESS FOR INTERPRETING CODE AND THEN ACTUATING MOVEMENT THAN A COMPUTER. THE HUMAN MAKES DECISIONS ABOUT THE CODE, HOW TO EXECUTE IT AND IF THEY WANT TO CHANGE HOW THIS IS DONE ALL WITHIN THE TIMESPAN OF THE PERFORMANCE. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN PERFORMING A SECTION OF THE SCORE THAT LINKS “LOOP”, “4”, AND “RIGHT”, THE DANCER MIGHT PERFORM A GESTURE WITH THE RIGHT ARM FOUR TIMES WHILE FACING AWAY FROM THE AUDIENCE. HOWEVER, IF THEY TURN AND FACE THE AUDIENCE, THE RIGHT COULD BE READ BY THE AUDIENCE AS LEFT AND THE DANCER MAY CHOSE TO CHANGE THE ARM THEY ARE MOVING BASED ON THIS. THEY ARE STILL FOLLOWING THE CODE BUT CHANGING HOW THE CODE HAS INFLUENCED THE CHOREOGRAPHY. WHAT IS ALSO IMPORTANT IS THE NATURE OF TIME IN THIS PROCESS. THE CODE IS CHANGING AND IN REAL-TIME BASED UPON THE SOUND, MEANING THAT THE DANCER’S DECISIONS ARE IMPROVISED INSTANTANEOUS REACTIONS. THE PROCESS OF READING, INTERPRETING AND PERFORMING IS INTERRELATED IN EACH MOMENT OF THE WORK AND BECOMES AS MUCH AS A MENTAL AWARENESS EXERCISE AS IT DOES PHYSICAL. THE AUDIENCE IS ALSO AWARE OF THIS THOUGHT PROCESS BECAUSE THE CODE IS PROJECTED WITHIN THE PIECE. THE AUDIENCE SEE THE SCORE CHANGE AND SEES THE DANCER RESPOND, ALLOWING FOR A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT WITH THE PIECE. THE TORQUE OF THE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES OF COMBINATIONS OF CHOREOGRAPHY AS GENERATED BY THE COMPUTER ARE THEN FURTHER TWISTED IN THE MIND OF THE PERFORMER IN THE SAME MOMENT IT IS DEVELOPED AND PERFORMED. SUMMARY CODE IS BEING DEVELOPED AS A SITE FOR CHOREOGRAPHY THROUGH VARIOUS RECONSIDERATIONS OF THE DEFINITION OF CHOREOGRAPHY. THROUGH THIS THE USE OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND COMPUTATION MAY BE USED AS A CHOREOGRAPHIC TOOL TO CREATE GENERATIVE CODE- SCORES IN REAL-TIME. SOUND CHOREOGRAPHER < > BODY CODE USES COMPUTATION TO CREATE A DIGRAMMATIC DANCE SCORE IN WHICH THE LANGUAGE AND CONNECTION OF WORDS MUST BE TRANSLATED INTO MOVEMENT BY A PERFORMER AS THE SCORE IS DEVELOPING AND CHANGING IN REAL-TIME. THE EVERY CHANGING ROLES OF THE TECHNOLOGY, PERFORMERS AND MOVEMENT ARE CONNECTED IN A TWISTING FORCE THAT CREATES THE FINAL PIECE WHILST IT IS BEING PERFORMED. REFERENCES ALIE/N A(C)TION.
