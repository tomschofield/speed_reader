MEDIA BEGINS WITH THE TWISTING SKEINS OF CHIFFON THROWN BY THE SERPENTINE AND BUTTERFLY DANCERS. MEDIA AS WE KNOW IT, AS WE KNOW IT TODAY IN OUR LCD SCREENS, BEGINS WITH TWISTS OF CLOTH, SHAPES MADE AND REMADE OUT OF BODILY GESTURES COMBINED WITH FABRIC. ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS OF THE SERPENTINE DANCERS WAS LOÏE FULLER, WHO BEGAN HER CAREER ON STAGE, UNDER COLOURED LIGHTS AND REFLECTED BY MIRRORS TO BATHE AND MULTIPLY HER BODY AND SHE DECORATED HER CLOTHING WITH PHOSPHORESCENT DESIGNS THAT TWINKLED ALMOST INDEPENDENTLY. SHE WAS THE SCREEN BEFORE THE SCREEN APPEARED. A LIVE PRESENCE, IN MOVEMENT, IT WAS AS IF SHE WOULD SQUEEZE MORE MOVEMENT FROM HERSELF BY MOBILISING COILS OF LIGHT, AIRY MATERIAL, AS EXTENSIONS OF HER GYRATIONS. HER PERFORMANCE WAS A MOVEMENT, A PERFORMANCE OF MOVEMENT, OF MOVEMENT BEYOND MOVEMENT – AN OCCUPATION OF SPACE, IN WHICH SPACE WAS FILLED OUT BY TEXTURES, FOLDS, REFLECTIONS, INTERFERENCES, DISTURBANCES. SHE DEBUTED AT THE FOLIES BERGÈRE IN 1892-3, PLAYING A HYPNOTISED SUBJECT. SHE STRUTTED ACROSS THE STAGE, LIFTING UP HER LONG SKIRTS. THESE MOVES MADE HER REALISE – JUST AS DID THE VITALISTS IN THE SAME MOMENT – HOW MUCH OF A LIFE MATERIAL POSSESSES, OR, AT LEAST, IT MAY POSSESS IF MOBILISED BY HUMAN OR OTHER NATURAL ENERGIES. FULLER DEVELOPED HER REPERTOIRE OF MOVEMENTS INTO A SCULPTURAL CHOREOGRAPHY. SHE STUDIED THE MOVEMENT BEHAVIOURS OF SILKS. SHE OBSERVED WHAT HAPPENED WHEN FABRIC, LIGHT AND COLOUR WERE THROWN TOGETHER IN DANCE. SHE FOUND WAYS OF INTENSIFYING SHIMMER, CHANGING EACH COLOURED LIGHT THAT HIT HER BODY EACH TIME SHE STRUCK A MOVE OR A POSE. SHE FLUNG AROUND HER METRES AND METRES OF CREPE DE CHINE, WHICH TWIRLED AND LET THROUGH THE LIGHT. SHE LET HER BODY AND ITS FABRIC BECOME THE SURFACE FOR MAGIC LANTERN PROJECTIONS. ‘LIGHT AND COLOR’, ‘THROWN GREAT MASSES OF SILK WAS MY REAL REPRESENTATION AND NOT DANCING AT ALL’, SHE SAID OF HER WORK. (SALLY R. SOMMER, ‘LOÏE FULLER’, DRAMA REVIEW, 65, 1975, P. 58) THE POET MALLARME DESCRIBED HER AS A ‘PHANTASMAGORIA OF DUSK AND GROTTO’. (STÉPHANE MALLARMÉ, OEUVRES COMPLÈTES, BIBLIOTHÈQUE DE LA PLÉIADE, NO. 65, 1945, P. 308.) SHE FROZE INTO ORCHIDS, CLOUDS, BUTTERFLIES, AND LATER, BECOMING MORE AND MORE ABSTRACT, SHE EVOKED SNOWSTORMS OR RIPPLING WATER. OTHERS FOLLOWED IN HER WAKE, IMITATING THE SAME TWISTS AND TURNS. SUCH MOBILITY, SUCH POWER OF TORSION, WAS, IN TURN, CAPTURED BY THE MOVING ARTS OF FILM RECORDING, JUST AS IT WAS CAPTURED BY IMITATORS. ALL OF THE ‘FATHERS’ OF CINEMA MADE THIS TYPE OF FILM: EDISON, DICKSON, LOUIS LUMIÈRE AND PAUL NADAR. EDISON RELEASED FOUR FILM VERSIONS OF A SERPENTINE DANCE BY ANNABELLE WHITFORD. ONE OF THESE STRIPS WAS EXHIBITED AT THE FIRST KINETOSCOPE PARLOUR, WHICH OPENED IN OCTOBER 1894 AT 20 BOULEVARD POISSONNIÈRE, IN PARIS. THE LUMIÈRE BROTHERS MADE A FILM OF A SERPENTINE DANCE IN 1897. THE PERFORMANCE LASTED FOR FIFTY SECONDS ON A WOODEN STAGE. THESE LITTLE FILMS WERE BRIGHTLY COLOURED, EACH FRAME TINTED BY APPLICATIONS OF PAINT DIRECTLY ON FILM STOCK. NOT ONLY DID THE MATERIAL TWIRL, THE COLOURS SLID THROUGH THE SPECTRUM, DETACHED FROM THE REAL WORLD. IT WAS A RAINBOW OF SENSATIONS, LIGHT BENT AND SCATTERED IN MANY HUES. THE SHORT STRIPS CAPTURE THE MOBILISATION OF MATERIAL, THE SWIRLING FORMS AND TRANSFORMING COLOURS OF COILS AND FANS OF MATERIAL AS IT IS TWISTED BY GIRLS PERFORMING THEIR BUTTERFLY AND SERPENTINE DANCES. THE GIRLS’ BODIES DISAPPEAR PERIODICALLY, ENGULFED BY MATERIAL. THE BODIES ARE ELEMENTS THAT ENABLE THE ENDLESS ANIMATED FLOW OF MATERIAL TO TWIST AND TURN AND DISPLAY ITS MATERIAL QUALITIES. THE FABRIC COILS FOR AS LONG AS THE FILM STRIP COILS THROUGH THE PROJECTOR. AROUND ONE THIRD OF FILMS MADE IN THE FIRST TWENTY YEARS OF CINEMA WERE OF THIS TYPE, GARISHLY HAND-COLOURED AND SHORT. THE GIRLS TWIST. THE CLOTH TWISTS. THE FILM PROJECTOR TWISTS. THE FILM STRIP TWISTS THROUGH THE PROJECTOR. WHAT FILM TWISTS INTO BEING IS NARRATIVE EVENTUALLY. THE FIFTY SECONDS BECOMES FIFTY MINUTES, OR LONGER, AND THERE IS TIME ENOUGH TO TELL STORIES WITH BEGINNINGS, MIDDLES AND ENDS, INCLUDING VARIOUS TWISTS AND TURNS OF PLOT ALONG THE WAY. THE FOLDS OF CLOTH MOBILISED INTO ACTIONS IS SUBSTITUTED OVER TIME BY THE TWISTS AND TURNS OF A STORYLINE. AT THE SAME TIME AS FILM CAPITALISED ON THE SERPENTINE DANCERS, ANIMATION CAME INTO BEING, AND IT SET IN MOTION FILMS’ TURN TOWARD NARRATIVE. THE FIRST NARRATIVE ANIMATION DEVICE WAS CHARLES- ÉMILE REYNAUD’S INVENTION, THE THEATRE OPTIQUE, ON WHICH HE SHOWED HIS OWN PAUVRE PIERROT AND OTHER ‘LUMINOUS PANTOMIMES’, OR ANIMATIONS. THESE STRIPS BROKE WITH THE REPETITIVE NATURE OF MOVEMENT IN PREVIOUS DEVICES, INCLUDING HIS OWN PRAXINOSCOPE, WHICH HAD SIMPLY SPUN AND SPUN AND REPEATED A SINGLE MOVEMENT – A RAT LEAPING ON A MAN, A GIRL FEEDING HENS, A HORSE JUMPING. REYNAUD’S PROTO-CINEMATIC PLATES ON A BAND WITH SPROCKETS ALLOWED FOR THE UNFURLING OF A STORY. THE FLEXIBLE BAND OF ANIMATED IMAGES COULD BE AS LONG AS THE DRAWING ANIMATOR COULD BEAR, FOR MORE SECONDS OF STORY TIME COULD BE GAINED WITH THE ADDITION OF EACH FURTHER DRAWING. THERE WERE BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVEN HUNDRED MOBILE IMAGES IN REYNAUD’S LUMINOUS PANTOMIMES, AND EACH WOULD TWINKLE ON THE SCREEN FOR A SECOND OR TWO. THIS LENGTH OF TIME AND ABILITY FOR VARIETY TURNED MOVEMENT INTO ACTION. IT PERMITTED THE TELLING OF A STORY, WITH A BEGINNING, MIDDLE AND AN END. THE TWISTS OF THE BAND MADE POSSIBLE THE TWISTS OF A NARRATIVE. IT PRODUCED TIME AND FILLED IT WITH ACTIVITIES. IT ALSO CONSUMED MINUTES, NOT SECONDS, OF ATTENTION. WITH THIS GAIN IN TIME, THE QUESTIONS BEGIN OF WHAT A STORY MIGHT BE, AND UNHAPPY ENDINGS, IN THESE EARLY DAYS, WERE AS LIKELY AS HAPPY ONES. ANIMATED OPTICAL CULTURE BEGINS TO TELL STORIES. INAUGURATED IN THIS IS A CERTAIN IMBRICATION OF TWO TYPES OF INSCRIPTION, IMAGE AND STORY, OR THE VISUAL AND THE VERBAL, OR THE FILM AND THE BOOK. ANIMATED CULTURE BEGINS ITS DRAWN- OUT AND NEVER COMPLETED FATE: TO SUPPLANT THE BOOK. A STORY TELLING MACHINE IS IN PLACE. MODERN HUMANS, TECHNOLOGISED AND MEDIATISED, ARE ANIMATED THROUGH THIS STORY-TELLING MACHINE. IT HAS COLOURS AND TWISTS AND TURNS AND IT CONTORTS AND DISTORTS FOR US AND IN US. WE BECOME ITS PUNCTUATION MARK – ITS END OF THE LINE – AS MACHINIC LABOUR, AS SUBJECTS OF BUREAUCRACY, AS CINEMA VIEWERS. WE ARE INSTITUTED BY OUR TECHNOLOGIES. WE INSTITUTE THEM IN THE LIGHT OF WHAT WE HAVE BECOME. AFTER FILM, THE TWISTING MOTION IS APPROPRIATED FOR TELEVISION. THE DANCING BODIES AND FABRIC WILL BE SIMULATED, IN THE EARLY DAYS, BY FELIX THE CAT, AN ANIMATED FELINE FROM NEW YORK. HE GETS BROADCASTED IN 1928, WHEN HIS ROTATING 3D 13 INCH PAPIER MACHE BODY, HIS MATTER, WAS PARSED THROUGH THE MECHANISM OF A SCANNER TO AN ELECTRIC KINESCOPE RECEIVER. FELIX THE CAT PROVIDED THE FIRST TV TEST IMAGE: HE ARRIVED ON SCREENS DOTTED ACROSS THE CITY, TWO INCHES HIGH AND COMPOSED OF FAT GREY LINES. MINIATURISED, FLATTENED, DIS- AND RE- ASSEMBLED,ALMOST IMMATERIALLY COMPOSED OF LINES, FELIX GREETS THE VIEWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE, FROM AN ELSEWHERE THAT IS DISTANT TO HIMSELF TOO, THROUGH THE INTERFACE OF TV. FELIX SPAN ON THAT TURNTABLE FOR A DECADE, INTO THE LATER 1930S, AS THE LINES NARROWED AND THE FOCUS SHARPENED AND TECHNICIANS STROVE FOR IMPROVEMENTS IN DEFINITION. FELIX THE CAT BECOMES PART OF MEDIA HISTORY. IN WATCHING HIM IN HIS CARTOON APPEARANCES, HIS DESPERATE URBAN TALES OF THWARTED LOVE, HUNGER, THE USUAL MISERY OF CITY LIVES, HIS TAIL TWIRLING AND CONTORTING, SOMETIMES EVEN INTO WORDS OR QUESTION MARKS, SOMETIMES INTO THINGS, WE FIND THAT, LIKE THE CAT IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM, OR THE CAT ON OUR LAP, HE WILL BECOME DOMESTICATED, THAT IS, PART OF OUR HOME, OUR MODERN TWENTIETH CENTURY HOMES. HIS TV IMAGE WILL BE DOMESTICATED TOO AND SO THEREBY WILL THE TELEVISION COME TO TAKE UP A PLACE IN THE CORNER OF OUR ROOM, OR IN THE CENTRE OF IT, ANGLING OUR VISION, MAKING US ALL TWIST OUR HEADS TOWARDS IT. FELIX TWISTS ON THE PLATE FOR BROADCAST. IN THIS GYRATION, THIS CONTORTION OF OR BY ANIMATION, ITS RUBBER LIMBS STRETCHING, WE SIT. HE SLINKS. THE TV FIZZES WITH ENERGY AND LIFE. THE TWISTING CLOTH OF SERPENTINE DANCERS. THE EMERGENCE OF TWISTS OF FILM. THE TWISTS AND TURNS OF FILM DEVELOP INTO NARRATIVE. TWISTING FELIX BEING TURNED INTO LINES SUITABLE FOR BROADCASTING THROUGH TV. IT IS NOT JUST OPTICAL CULTURE THAT GENUFLECTS TO THE GESTURE OF THE TWIST. THERE IS ALSO TWIST OF THE RADIO DIAL. BUT IT IS ONLY THE HAND THAT IS MOBILISED FOR THIS TWIST – THE HAND TWISTS THE DIAL TO MAKE LANGUAGE AND SOUND SHIFT, TWISTING, PRODUCING THE ARTICULATE, SLIDING INTO THE INARTICULATE. ONLY JAMES JOYCE REALLY UNDERSTOOD HOW LANGUAGE WAS TWISTED BY THIS MEDIA TECHNOLOGY OF RADIO. HARRY LEVIN OBSERVED IN 1941 THAT JOYCE REPLACED THE ARCHANGEL’S TRUMPET WITH AN ELECTRIC AMPLIFIER AND INSISTED FURTHER THAT THE ‘LOUDSPEAKER’ OF RADIO IS THE MEDIUM OF FINNEGANS WAKE. (HARRY LEVIN, JAMES JOYCE: A CRITICAL INTRODUCTION, FABER, LONDON, 1941, P. 67.) IT IS INDEED A RADIO BOOK, COMPOSED BY A MAN WHO LISTENED TO RADIO EIREANN EVERY DAY. JOYCE INCLUDES BROADCASTS AT POINTS IN THE NARRATIVE AND THERE ARE DIRECT REFERENCES TO RADIO, SUCH AS: ‘THE EAR OF FIONN EARWICKER AFORETIME WAS THE TRADEMARK OF A BROADCASTER WITH WICKER LOCAL JARGON FOR AN ACE’S PATENT (HEAR! CALLS! EVERYWHAIR!) THEN AS TO THIS RADIOOSCILLATING EPIEPISTLE TO WHICH COTTON, SILK OR SAMITE, KOHOL, GALL OR BRICKDUST, WE MUST CEASELESSLY RETURN’ (JAMES JOYCE, FINNEGANS WAKE, BOOK 1, CHAPTER 5.) MOREOVER, THE WHOLE BOOK, WITH ITS GLUT OF LANGUAGES, ITS PARODIES OF EVERY STYLE AND GENRE, ITS CODE MIXING AND SWITCHING, RECREATES THE EXPERIENCE OF SURFING THROUGH ENDLESS RADIO STATIONS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES, THE BLASTS OF JINGLES OR NONSENSICAL EAR- CATCHING COMMERCIALS. IT CATCHES TOO THE SOUNDS OF THE BUZZ AND FUZZ AND WHELPING THAT OCCURS BETWEEN TUNED IN STATIONS. THE BOOK IS A BOOK FOR THE EAR, JOYCE’S OWN EAR PICKING UP THE AIRS OF RADIO EIREANN, WHICH MERGED WITH WHAT HE CLAIMED WAS THE SOUND OF STATIC IN HIS PARIS APARTMENT, THE RESULT OF THE VIBRATIONS OF PAST LIVES, PAST VOICES. MODERN LIVES ARE REORIENTED AROUND THE MOBILISATION OF MATERIAL AND OF THE IMMATERIAL, THE ENERGY OF WIND AND WAVES, RADIO WAVES AND ELECTRIC WINDS, THE VISIONS OF AMBULANT COLOURFUL STUFF, MOVING ITSELF, OF LINES IN MOVEMENT AND BROADCAST TO EVERYONE FROM A HIDDEN ABODE OF PRODUCTION, OF SOUNDS RIPPED FROM THE AIR, AND ADDRESSING US AND EVERYONE ELSE. THE REORIENTATION IS THE POINT, TO BE PULLED THIS WAY, INTO THE MODERN MODE OF LIVING, MOVING, GESTURING, FLEXING ONE’S SELF INTO THE NEW NOW. THINKING TOO ADAPTS TO THIS FLEXING MOTION, AS EXEMPLIFIED IN BERTOLT BRECHT’S THINKING ABOUT THOUGHT FROM THE SECOND HALF OF THE 1930S. ME-TI; BOOK OF TRANSFORMATIONS OR BOOK OF CHANGES OR BOOK OF TWISTS AND TURNS OR BOOK OF TURNING AYS, WAS NOT PUBLISHED WHEN BRECHT WAS ALIVE. (BERTOLT BRECHT, ME-TI. BUCH DER WENDUNGEN, SUHRKAMP, FRANKFURT/MAIN, 1972.) IT EMULATES WRITINGS BY THE CHINESE DIALECTICIAN AND ANTI-CONFUCIAN OF THE CLASSICAL PERIOD ME-TI (OR MO-DZI), WHO WAS REGARDED BY MANY NINETEENTH- CENTURY SCHOLARS AS A PROTO-SOCIALIST. THE SUBTITLE − BOOK OF TWISTS AND TURNS, OR TURNING WAYS − STEMS FROM A CONFUCIAN TEXT – THE I-CHING – WHICH CAN BE TRANSLATED LIKEWISE AS THE BOOK OF TRANSFORMATIONS. BRECHT IN YOKING TWO DIVERGENT THINGS TOGETHER WAS ACTING ECLECTICALLY, BUT WAS ALSO ENSTAGING CONTRADICTION. SUCH A STANCE ARGUABLY UNDERWRITES THE WHOLE OF ME-TI,AN ATTEMPT TO REFLECT CRITICALLY ON THE METHOD OF THINKING CONTRADICTION, OF DIALECTICS. BRECHT’S CHINESE FASCINATIONS – COMPRISING PHILOSOPHY AND METHOD AS WELL AS THEATRICAL PRACTICE – DEVIATE FROM STALINIST DOGMA, OFFERING INSTEAD AN ARTICULATION OF THE DIALECTIC IN TERMS OF FLOW, FLUX, CHANGE, TRANSFORMATION. GIVEN THAT ME-TI’S ORIGINAL EFFORT ATTEMPTED TO ESTABLISH RULES OF BEHAVIOUR IN RELATION TO SOCIO-POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS, BRECHT’S APHORISTIC MIMICRIES FOREGROUND THE QUESTION OF INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOUR IN THE CONTEXT OF COLLECTIVES. THE SELF TOO IS NOT EXEMPT FROM THIS PROCESS OF CONTRADICTION, NOR DISCONNECTED FROM THE LARGER CONTEXT, WHICH MAY BE RIVEN BY THE SAME CONTRADICTIONS: “ME-TI SAID: IT IS ADVANTAGEOUS, NOT MERELY TO THINK ACCORDING TO THE GREAT METHOD BUT TO LIVE ACCORDING TO THE GREAT METHOD AS WELL. NOT TO BE IDENTICAL WITH ONESELF, TO EMBRACE AND INTENSIFY CRISES, TO TURN SMALL CHANGES INTO GREAT ONES AND SO FORTH – ONE NEED NOT ONLY OBSERVE SUCH PHENOMENA, ONE CAN ALSO ACT THEM OUT. ONE CAN LIVE WITH GREATER OR FEWER MEDIATIONS, IN MORE NUMEROUS OR LESS NUMEROUS RELATIONSHIPS. ONE CAN AIM AT OR STRIVE FOR A MORE DURABLE TRANSFORMATION OF ONE’S CONSCIOUSNESS BY MODIFYING ONE’S SOCIAL BEING. ONE CAN HELP TO MAKE THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE STATE MORE CONTRADICTORY AND THEREBY MORE CAPABLE OF DEVELOPMENT.” (FREDRIC JAMESON, BRECHT AND METHOD, VERSO, LONDON, 1998, P. 30. SEE ALSO SERGEI ZEMLYANOI, ‘BERTOLD BRECHT’S PROJECT FOR HUMANITY’, IN CHTO DELAT, SEPTEMBER, 2009. SEE ALSO EMILY PETHICK/PEIO AGUIRRE, CASCO ISSUES X: THE GREAT METHOD, 2007.) THIS IS THE MODERN FLEXIBILITY OF A POST-REVOLUTIONARY SELF, OR A SELF ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS OF REVOLUTIONISING THINGS. THE SELF TEARS OPENS ITS OWN BEING IN ORDER TO TRANSFORM CONSCIOUSNESS, TO BE MADE ANEW, BUT IT ALSO BAULKS AT INSTITUTIONS, WORKING AGAINST THEM, TUGGING AT THEM, TRANSGRESSING THEIR LIMITS IN ORDER TO PUSH THE SETTLEDNESS OF THE GIVEN INTO CONTRADICTION. IT IS AS IF THE SELF ACTS AS A FULCRUM EXERTING FORCE ON THE SOLID MASS OF WHAT IS TO TURN IT, TWIST IT INTO SOMETHING ELSE. REVOLUTIONARY POLITICS IS PRONE TO BORROW ITS METAPHORS FROM ENGINEERING AND PHYSICS, IN ORDER TO EXPRESS THE MOMENT AND THE PROCESS OF REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE. EVERY QUESTION ‘RUNS IN A VICIOUS CIRCLE’ BECAUSE POLITICAL LIFE AS A WHOLE IS AN ENDLESS CHAIN CONSISTING OF AN INFINITE NUMBER OF LINKS. THE WHOLE ART OF POLITICS LIES IN FINDING AND TAKING AS FIRM A GRIP AS WE CAN OF THE LINK THAT IS LEAST LIKELY TO BE STRUCK FROM OUR HANDS, THE ONE THAT IS MOST IMPORTANT AT THE GIVEN MOMENT, THE ONE THAT MOST OF ALL GUARANTEES ITS POSSESSOR THE POSSESSION OF THE WHOLE CHAIN. IF WE HAD A CREW OF EXPERIENCED BRICKLAYERS WHO HAD LEARNED TO WORK SO WELL TOGETHER THAT THEY COULD LAY THEIR BRICKS EXACTLY AS REQUIRED WITHOUT A GUIDE LINE (WHICH, SPEAKING ABSTRACTLY, IS BY NO MEANS IMPOSSIBLE), THEN PERHAPS WE MIGHT TAKE HOLD OF SOME OTHER LINK. BUT IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT AS YET WE HAVE NO EXPERIENCED BRICKLAYERS TRAINED FOR TEAMWORK, THAT BRICKS ARE OFTEN LAID WHERE THEY ARE NOT NEEDED AT ALL, THAT THEY ARE NOT LAID ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LINE, BUT ARE SO SCATTERED THATTHE ENEMY CAN SHATTER THE STRUCTURE AS IF IT WERE MADE OF SAND AND NOT OF BRICKS. (LENIN, WHAT IS TO BE DONE?, PROGRESS, MOSCOW, 1975, P. 219.) LENIN’S METAPHOR SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS A MOMENT OF INTERVENTION, A HOLDING ON TO SOMETHING THAT SLIPS AND CIRCLES PAST, SMOOTHLY, REPELLING ALL TOO EASY A GRIP. THE CHAIN IS A BAND THAT LOOPS AND GLIDES BY, COMPRISED OF ACTIONS AND COUNTER ACTIONS, LINKS THAT ARE PROMISING, THOSE THAT GO NOWHERE, THOSE THAT ARE WEAK AND THOSE THAT ARE STRONG AND CAN FORGE MORE LINKS. IN ADDITION, THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES LAY BRICKS HERE AND THERE, BUT ARE UNABLE TO BUILD THEM SYSTEMATICALLY, TO MAKE ANYTHING STRONG, ANY BULWARK AGAINST THE FORCES OF THE RULING CLASS. THIS WAS LENIN IN 1902 WRITING IN WHAT IS TO BE DONE? THE PROBLEM WAS ONE OF MASS AND ORGANISATION. THE DOMINANT CLASS IS POWERFUL. HISTORY DOES NOT SEEM TO BE IN ANY WAY ON THE SIDE OF THE RIGHTEOUS. ANY VICTORY MUST BE SNATCHED, ALMOST BY A LUCKY GRAB INTO THE UNPREDICTABLE COMPLEXITY OF WORLD HISTORY. SOME THIRTY YEARS LATER, WALTER BENJAMIN DEVELOPS ANOTHER METAPHOR TO CONSIDER THE WAYS IN WHICH POLITICAL ACTIVITY,AND POLITICAL THINKING, MIGHTDEVELOP, WITH A MORE DIALECTICAL CONCEPTION OF THE RELATION OF PARTS IN THE PROCESS OF WORLD HISTORICAL MOVEMENT. IN FACT HE SUMMONS UP THE TORQUE FORCES OF SAILING TO CONCEPTUALISE THE UNFURLING AND THE STEERING OF HISTORICAL MOVEMENT. IN THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL SECTION OF THE ARCADES PROJECT, KNOWN AS FILE N, HE DEFINES THE CONCEPT OF RETTUNG, RESCUE OR SALVATION OF THE HISTORICAL PROCESS IN RELATION TO A METAPHOR:[N 9, 2] RE THE CONCEPT OF ‘RESCUE’: THE WIND OF THE ABSOLUTE IN THE SAILS OF THE CONCEPT. (THE PRINCIPLE OF THE WIND IS THE CYCLICAL.) THE TRIM OF THE SAIL IS THE RELATIVE. (WALTER BENJAMIN, FILE N, THE ARCADES PROJECT, HARVARD, CAMBRIDGE, MA, 1999, P. 473.) HISTORY MOVES AS AN ABSOLUTE, CYCLING, ETERNALLY RETURNING THE SAME OLD OPPRESSIONS, BECOMING LIKE NATURE. BUT THE CONCEPT, THE CONCEPTUAL MOMENT OF ANALYSIS, OF FASHIONING UNDERSTANDING, IS A SAIL, CUTS THROUGH AND YET GLIDES OFF THE WIND, UTILISING IT, CAPTURING ITS ENERGIES FOR ANOTHER DEFINED PROJECT. THE SAIL MUST BE PULLED IN TO THE POINT WHERE IT FILLS UP WITH WIND, ITS LUFF IN LINE WITH THE WIND’S LINE OF MOVEMENT. HOW DOES A BOAT SAIL? HOW DOES IT USE THE WIND IN ITS SAILS AND THE WATER AROUND IT? WIND AND WATER, TWO HORIZONTAL FORCES, CANCEL OUT EACH OTHER’S POWER, BUT MAKE A TORQUE THAT TILTS THE BOAT ONE WAY. THE BUOYANCY AND WEIGHT OF THE VESSEL, TWO OTHER EQUALS AND OPPOSITES, MAKE A TORQUE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. CANCELLING AND BALANCING, MOBILISING FORCES AND NEGATING THEM IS THE ART OF MOVEMENT, OF REVOLUTION. TO THIS BENJAMIN ADDS THE SAIL AS A CRUCIAL COMPONENT THAT DIRECTS THE ENERGIES THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE SCUPPER THE BOAT. THESE ENERGIES ARE, HE DEFINES ELSEWHERE, THE PROCESS OF HISTORY WHICH BLOWS ON REGARDLESS. BUT THE ENERGY CAN BE ANGLED, CAN BE TAKEN CONTROL OF, DIRECTED. FOR THE THEORIST, FOR BENJAMIN HIMSELF, THE POINT IS TO HAVE AN ANGLE, TO THINK IN RELATION TO A PROJECT, AND ONE THAT CAN DEVELOP WORLD HISTORY IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION. WHAT MATTERS FOR THE DIALECTICIAN IS HAVING THE WIND OF WORLD HISTORY IN HIS SAILS. THINKING FOR HIM MEANS: TO SET THE SAILS. IT IS THE WAY THEY ARE SET THAT MATTERS. WORDS ARE HIS SAILS. THE WAY THEY ARE SET TURNS THEM INTO CONCEPTS. (WALTER BENJAMIN, FILE N, THE ARCADES PROJECT, 1999, P. 473.) BENJAMIN’S INSISTENCE IS THAT A VOCABULARY OF REVOLUTION NEEDS TO CUT ITS WAY THROUGH THE MORASS OF POOR THINKING OR CORRUPTED FANTASY. THE WIND OF HISTORY, THE ANGLING OF THE RELATIVE TOWARDS THE ABSOLUTE, IS BENJAMIN’S CONCERN, FOR OTHERWISE THERE IS ONLY THE PASSIVE, MISERABLY BEING BLOWN BY THE STORM OF PROGRESS INTO OBLIVION. THE SAILS ARE TWISTED INTO POSITION. SOME TWISTS BREAK THINGS OFF. AT A GIVEN POINT QUANTITY TURNS INTO QUALITY. TORSION, THE TWISTING OF THE SELF IN RESPONSE TO THE TECHNOLOGIES, THE MEDIA, THE TECHNIQUES, THE LANGUAGES OF AN ENVIRONMENT THAT COMES INCREASINGLY TO BE COMPRISED OF TWISTING THINGS, OF MECHANISMS THAT TURN REPETITIVELY, ENDLESSLY,AUTOMATICALLY. IT WAS IN ITS VARIOUS CULTURED FORMS, AS DANCE, AS ANIMATION, AS FILM, AS TV TEST TRANSMISSION, AS RADIO DIAL, MET BY THE TWISTS OF DIALECTICAL, POLITICAL CRITICAL THOUGHT, A PRE- ARTICULATION OF WHAT TWISTS FOR US TODAY, ENDLESSLY: THE TWISTED NEMATICS OF THE LIQUID CRYSTAL. THE POWER OF THE SERPENTINE DANCER TO TWIST, THE POWER OF FELIX TO BE TURNED, THE POWER OF THE RADIO DIAL TO SUMMON UP AND CANCEL OUT LANGUAGES, IS CAPTURED AND REGULARISED IN LIQUID CRYSTAL. THESE LITTLE ANIMATED FORMS WE WATCH AS THEY TWIST, IN TORSION, ON SCREENS, ON THE WALLS, ON OUR DESKS, ON THE GADGETS IN OUR POCKETS. THEY TWIST AND TURN TO APPROXIMATE THE COLOURS OF NATURE, WHEN AN ELECTRICAL CHARGE SHOOTS THROUGH THEM. IT IS AS IF THEY HAVE BODIES WRACKED IN PAIN, HIT BY TASERS THAT CAUSE THEM TO WRITHE. OR IT IS AS IF THEY DANCE, LIKE SERPENTINE DANCERS, SWIRLING, BEING MOVEMENT AND COLOUR, SHAPE AND EVANESCENCE. THEY ARE LIQUID CRYSTALS. THEY TWIST TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MAKING OF THE SCREEN’S COLOURS. WE DO NOT SEE THEIR TWIST, ONLY THE RESULTS. WE DO NOT SEE THEIR COLOURS, ONLY THE PIXELS THAT THEY OPERATE. THE LIQUID CRYSTAL, WITH ITS TWISTING CAPACITIES, WAS CAPTURED AND DOMINATED. LIKE AN UNWILLING PROTEUS, THESE QUASI-LIFE FORMS WERE INTERNED IN MACHINES, IN ORDER TO REVEAL OUR PASTS AND FUTURES, OUR WORLDS IN HEIGHTENED COLOURS ON SCREENS. LIQUID CRYSTAL’S FLEET MERCURIAL MOTIONS ARE HARNESSED BY CGI SOFTWARE, AS FUNCTION AND AS LOOK. ITS NATURAL OPALESCENCE AND SHEEN ARE APPROPRIATED BY DIGITAL AESTHETICS, SO THAT SCENARIOS OF RAPID TRANSFORMATION, FLUID MOTION, CAN BE RECREATED FOR DELIGHTFUL SPECTACULAR DISPLAYS. 3D MODELLING AND PRINTING, MOBILISING THE SUPPLE POWER OF THE LIQUID CRYSTAL, ALLOWS, SEEMINGLY, A PULLING, TWISTING, STRETCHING, DENTING AND EXTRUDING OF LIQUID CRYSTALS – AS IF THEY WERE CLAY. CLAY WAS TOUCHED AND TWISTED INTO SHAPE BY HANDS, SOMETIMES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FORCE OF SPIN. NOW THE HANDS TOUCH KEYBOARDS, OR THE SCREEN. ON THE LIQUID CRYSTAL TOUCHSCREEN, FINGERS DANCE LIKE THE BUTTERFLY DANCER ANNABELLE OVER THE SURFACE, FLICKING, TURNING, JABBING. THE LIQUID CRYSTALS HAVE CLIMBED DOWN FROM THE SCREENS. THEY WERE INTIMATE WITH THE BODY IN EARLIER DAYS, FIRST APPEARING AS WATCHES AND CALCULATORS. LATELY THEY HAVE RECLAIMED THAT CLOSENESS, RESIDING MORE OR LESS COMFORTABLY IN EVERY POCKET OR BAG AS SMARTPHONE, TABLET, AUDIO DEVICE. THEY DEMAND TO BE TOUCHED. TOUCHSCREENS, THE RESISTIVE ONES, THE CAPACITIVE ONES, OR THE SURFACE WAVE ONES, HAVE VARIOUS MODES OF OPERATING THE HUMAN BODY, WHOSE CONTACT IS NEEDED TO DETONATE TOUCH EVENTS. THE RESISTIVE SCREENS ARE CONTENT WITH ANY HARD OBJECT TO PRESS DOWN AND MAKE CONTACT BETWEEN TWO LAYERS IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE ELECTRICAL FIELD. THE OTHER MODES DEPLOY THE HUMAN – OR ANY OTHER CONDUCTOR - AND ITS ELECTRICAL CHARGES AND PARTICIPATION IN ELECTRICAL FIELDS, IN ORDER TO OPERATE BY DISCHARGING ELECTRICITY IN THE USER OR MOBILISING THE HUMAN TO COMPLETE ELECTRICAL CIRCUITS OR BY DISRUPTING THE FLOW OF WAVES. OUR ELECTRICITY IS ABSTRACTED. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN, THE SIDE WHICH AWAITS THE TOUCH AND MONITORS THE CHANGES IN ELECTRIC STATE ON THE SCREEN IS COMPOSED OF RARE EARTH MINERALS AND METALS, SUCH AS INDIUM TIN OXIDE, WHICH IS HIGHLY CONDUCTIVE, EASY TO DEPOSIT ON THE GLASS AS A FILM – SPUTTERED ON IN VAPOUR – AND OPTICALLY TRANSPARENT. THE SCREEN IS EVER THINNER, AS IN SAMSUNG’S SUPER AMOLED SCREENS, USING LIGHT-EMITTING AND CHARGE-TRANSPORTING ORGANIC MATERIALS, WHICH HAS STRIPPED OUT ANOTHER LAYER AND PUTS THE FINGERS CLOSER STILL TO WHAT IS BEING TOUCHED ON THE SCREEN. WE ALMOST REACH THROUGH TO THE LUMINOUS CONFECTION OF THE DISPLAY. THIS LUMINOSITY GENERATES ITS OWN SELF, IS A SELF-REFLECTION OF LIGHT. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE HAD TO PRESS INTO THE SCREENS TO MAKE THE CIRCUITS WORK AND PERHAPS A RING OF PRISMATIC COLOURS WOULD FLOOD AROUND THE DENT. NOW THEIR SMOOTH SURFACES KEEP US OUT. OUR TOUCH LEAVES A GREASY MARK THAT BLOCKS OUR EXPERIENCE. BUT OUR EYES DIVE IN. THE TECHNOLOGY HAS NOW DEVELOPED TO READ THE BODY – FINGERTIP, NAIL, KNUCKLE. WE BECOME MULTIPLE INSTRUMENTS. OUR FINGERS SEE AS THEY TOUCH. OUR EYES TOUCH AS WE SEE. OUR BODY IS REFIGURED. WE ANGLE OURSELVES TOWARDS THE DEVICES AND EXERT THE NECESSARY FORCE OR HAVE IT EXERTED UPON US.
