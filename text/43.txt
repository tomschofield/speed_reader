ARE YOU ALIVE? I TOUCH YOU. THE POOL, H. D., 1915 WHAT DOES THE ACRONYM, CJD MEAN TO CONTEMPORARY UK ENGLISH SPEAKERS? OR BZ TO A PARTICULARLY INFORMED ENGLISH SPEAKER? MAD COW DISEASE, PERHAPS? AN INCAPACITATING CHEMICAL AGENT, WEAPONIZED BY UNITED STATES AFTER WWII, PERHAPS? WHAT COULD THE LETTERING BED MEAN OTHER THEN THE LAST REST PLACE OF THE DAY? WHEN THE FIRST TWO ARE VERBALISED IN THE CORRECT ALPHABET CODE WE GET THE PHRASES, ‘CHARLIE, JULIETTE, DELTA’ AND ‘BRAVO ZULU!’ AGAIN A TRAIL OF ASSOCIATIONS TAKES US INTO VARIOUS READINGS. CHARLIE AND JULIETTE, PERSONIFIED, GET TOGETHER AND BOOK PLANE TICKETS. A ZULU WARRIOR IS PATRONISED IN A GREETINGS CARD. A CHILD GETS THE IMPERATIVE COMMAND IN THE TOO LATE HOURS OF THE EVENING. OR MAYBE THAT’S JUST ME. WHAT DO WE SEE IN THIS IMAGE? IT LOOKS LIKE THE UKRAINIAN FLAG ON ITS SIDE, SO MY COMPREHENSION OF THE SYMBOL GRASPS TOWARDS MY WEAK READING OF CONTEMPORARY POLITICS. BECAUSE I’M A LINGUISTIC CREATURE, A MODERN HUMAN, I LOOK FOR PATTERNS OF MEANING IN AND BEYOND WORDS. I’LL IMPROVISE MEANING AND CONTINUE TO INTERPRET OR LOOK FOR IT EVEN BEYOND THE GIVEN TRANSLATION. WHEN DE- CODING MYSTERY ENCRYPTIONS, OR EVEN WHEN READING ‘ORDINARY’ LANGUAGE, THERE’S ALWAYS AN ELEMENT OF FANTASY, OR MAGICAL COMPREHENSION – CLAIRVOYANCE PERHAPS (BENJAMIN 1933). THE VERBAL EQUIVALENT OF THE ABOVE SYMBOL IS THE ALPHABET SYMBOL, ‘K’, OR SPOKEN PROPERLY, ‘KILO’. IN THE INTERNATIONAL CODE OF SIGNALS THIS SYMBOL IS SHORTHAND FOR A SHIP’S SIGNAL, ‘I WISH TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU’. AS A FLAG, HOISTED INTO POSITION, THIS SYMBOL IS THE STARTING POINT FOR ANY COMMUNICATIVE EXCHANGE AND ESTABLISHES THE FORMAT OF THE PROCEEDING TRANSMISSION. SUCH A SHIP- TO-SHIP PREAMBLE MIGHT GO LIKE THIS: KILO: I WISH TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU.... IN MORSE CODE / IN SEMAPHORE / IN TORCH AND FLARES WHAT THE KILO FLAG TELLS ME IS THAT BEFORE THE REASON FOR AND THE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION COMES THE DESIRE. AS A SOCIAL BEING, THE IMPULSE AND THE CAPACITY TO COMMUNICATE FEEL PRETTY COINCIDENT; THEY BOTH UNDERSCORE MOST OF WHAT I DO AS A POET AND A PERSON (NON-MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE POSITIONS). LIKE A LONELY SHIP AT SEA, I’M FREIGHTED WITH THE COMPULSION TO MAKE CONTACT WITH ANOTHER WANDERING BODY. NOT MUCH TIME PASSES BETWEEN MY SENDING SIGNALS INTO THE WORLD. THESE SIGNALS MIGHT CONTAIN PARTICULAR INFORMATION BUT WHAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY SIGNALLING IS MY HANKERING FOR COMMUNICATION. MAYBE I WOULDN’T BE SO QUICK TO MAKE THAT LEAP OF LIKENING A NAUTICAL FLAG SYMBOL WITH EVERYDAY SOCIAL MEDIATING OR POETIC UTTERANCE, IF THE INTERNATIONAL CODE DIDN’T ALREADY MAKE THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN TWO VESSELS READ LIKE THE PERSONAL DIALOGUE OF TWO INTIMATE SUBJECTS: THE FIRST PERSON SINGULAR ‘I’ DESIRING CONTACT WITH A ‘YOU’ LIKENS THE PHRASE DENOTED BY THE KILO FLAG TO A FORM OF A LYRICAL ADDRESS. IN OTHER WORDS IT SOUNDS LIKE THE ACT OF ONE SUBJECT APPEALING THROUGH LANGUAGE TO ANOTHER. WE CAN HEAR THE SAME IMPULSE TO APPEAL TO A LISTENER IN THE INITIAL CALL OF SHELLEY’S ODE TO A SKYLARK: HAIL TO THEE, BLITHE SPIRIT! (SHELLEY, 1820) THE HAIL FROM THE DESIRING SUBJECT PULLS THE AS-YET HEEDLESS AND UNNAMED INTO A LISTENING DYNAMIC. THEIR IDENTITY AS THE TARGET OF THE MESSAGE IS DETERMINED BY THE VERY ACT OF THE CALL. THIS IS COMMUNICATION AT ITS MOST BASIC FORM, AND THE GESTURE THAT LURKS BEHIND EVERY SIGNAL. FOXTROT: I AM DISABLED! COMMUNICATE WITH ME! (MY EXCLAMATION) I MIGHT SAY THAT THE DESIRE TO COMMUNICATE IS EMBEDDED IN CODE ITSELF, OR SHOULD THAT BE THE INSTRUCTION TO COMMUNICATE? WHERE CODE DEMANDS A PERFORMATIVE REALISATION OF ITS ENCRYPTION, THEN THE INSTRUCTION WITHIN THE CODE, KILO, IS TO TRANSLATE IT INTO A PROCESS OF INTERPELLATION. IN THE EARLY STAGES OF HER CAREER, HANNAH WEINER (CELEBRATED EAST COAST POET, PERFORMANCE ARTIST AND INTERMITTENT CLAIRVOYANT) COMMITTED HER PRACTICE TO APPROPRIATING SEQUENCES OF TEXT FROM A NINETEENTH- CENTURY EDITION OF THE INTERNATIONAL CODE OF SIGNALS FOR THE USE OF ALL NATIONS AND COMPOSED THEM INTO LINES OF POETRY FOR BOTH PAGE AND PERFORMANCE. THROUGHOUT THE 1960S WEINER ORCHESTRATED ELABORATE HAPPENINGS THAT SAW MASS ENACTMENTS OF SEAFARING SIGNALLING. THE PERFORMANCES TOOK PLACE IN (LAND-BASED) PUBLIC SPACES AND POETRY FESTIVALS, SIMILARLY LETTING COLLECTIVE BODIES TALK TO EACH OTHER IN PERSONAL MESSAGES OF LACK AND DESIRE, FEATURING THE U.S. COASTGUARD WITH ALPHABET FLAG HOISTS, SEMAPHORE SIGNALMEN, TORCH LIGHT, MEGAPHONES AND FLARES. IN WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN AN UNINTELLIGIBLE SPECTACLE, THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MAN AND MEDIA TRANSMITTED COMMUNIQUÉ IN SEQUENCES OF STANDARDISED MESSAGES THAT RENDERED THEM LYRICAL BALLADS TOUCHING ON SLAP-STICK EROTICA, PATHOS, BATHOS, WHIMSY, PASTORAL, AND CAPRICE. TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THIS AMATORY RE-TELLING OF ‘ROMEO’ AND ‘JULIET’, NO LONGER TRAPPED IN ALPHABET CODE BUT ONCE AGAIN BADLY COMMUNICATING LOVERS. GIA JULIET: SHJ XOR ROMEO: GDS GIT JULIET: MFO ROMEO: MFD JULIET: KZU ROMEO: OOX JULIET: HBK ROMEO: HAY JULIET: ODI ROMEO: LK JULIET: ODI ROMEO: HC JULIET: KZY ROMEO: BK JULIE: VLA ROMEO: IN 1982 SELECTED DERIVED FROM THE INTERNATIONAL CODE OF SIGNALS WERE COMPILED AND PUBLISHED IN THE BOOK, CODE POEMS. EACH CHAPTER – ‘ROMEO AND JULIET’; ‘ANY CHANCE OF WAR’; ‘WANT MEN’; ‘FOLLOW ME’ – BEHAVES LIKE A PASSAGE OF DIALOGUE, OR MINI CONVERSATION. TO MY READING THERE ARE SOME SECTIONS THAT PERFORM AS MUCH MELANCHOLY, AFFECT OR COMEDY AS ANY SONNET, BALLAD OR VERSE. CJD I WAS PLUNDERED BY A PIRATE CJF DESCRIBE THE PIRATE CJN SHE IS ARMED CJP HOW IS SHE ARMED? CJS SHE HAS LONG GUNS CJW I HAVE NO LONG GUNS BLD I AM A COMPLETE WRECK (WEINER 1982, 19) WEINER MANUFACTURED FOUND PHRASES FROM A SYSTEM OF IMPERSONAL MESSAGING AND FORMED THEM INTO A MODE OF PERSONAL LANGUAGE. IN DOING SO SHE SIMULTANEOUSLY REVEALED THE ALEATORIC LYRIC EFFECT IN APPROPRIATED TEXT, AND PROBLEMATISED THE VERY THIS IS MY BEST POINT SOME SWELL THANK YOU MAY I BEGIN TO? THE SOONER THE BETTER ENTRANCE IS DIFFICULT TRY TO ENTER I AM IN DIFFICULTIES; DIRECT ME HOW TO STEER YOU SHOULD SWING AND ENTER STERN FIRST WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE BOTTOM OR WHAT KIND OF BOTTOM DO HAVE YOU? DOUBLE BOTTOM STERN WAY. GOING ASTERN GO ASTERN EASY. EASY ASTERN I AM GOING FULL SPEED IT IS NOT SAFE TO GO SO FAST IT IS DIFFICULT TO EXTRICATE IS ANYTHING THE MATTER COCK BROKEN OR DAMAGED (WEINER 1982, 10) POSSIBILITY OF PERSONAL LANGUAGE. IN OTHER WORDS SHE SHOWED THAT WHILST COMPLICATING AN UTTERANCE’S ATTEMPT TO COMMUNICATE AS PERSONAL EXPRESSION ON ONE HAND, LYRICISM CREEPS IN ON THE OTHER. MIKE SIERRA KILO: IS MY FAMILY WELL? NOVEMBER: NO EVERY LINE OF CODE POEMS IS TESTIMONY TO THE DRAMA OF INTERPELLATION. WEINER’S PROJECT CREATED A VERNACULAR THAT UNDERMINES THE LINEARITY OF CODED COMMUNICATION AND ALSO REVEALS THE INTERPELLATIVE PRESSURE IN LYRIC POETRY – OR ANY LANGUAGE WITH A PRESCRIBED IDEOLOGY (EVEN THE ICOS IS AN IDEOLOGY). THE PERFORMATIVE CODE ENACTS A HAIL, WHICH IN TURN ENLISTS A RECEIVER. THE ACTUAL MESSAGE THAT IS MEDIATED BY THE SIGNAL – FOR EXAMPLE, I WANT BREAD; I NEED A PILOT; I REQUIRE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE; I DRAG MY ANCHOR; I HAVE NO LONG GUNS; I WANT MEN; I AM ON FIRE – IS THE ALMOST INCIDENTAL MATTER OF THE CALL. BY WHICH I MEAN, THE STUFF OF THE MESSAGE, THE SPECIFICITY OF THE DESIRE TO COMMUNICATE, IS THE CODE’S FLESH. SECTIONS OF WEINER’S WORKS OF POETRY ROMEO ZULU X-RAY: I WANT MORE SUPPORT WEINER WAS INTERESTED IN THE TIME AND SPACE OF COMMUNICATION; SHE WAS EXPLORING HOW A MESSAGE PASSES THROUGH TIME AND SPACE AND LIKEWISE THROUGH OUR MINDS AND OUR FLESHY BODIES. IN THE WORK SHE ASKS OF A TRANSMITTED MESSAGE: WHERE DOES THE MEANING DRIFT TO ALONG THE WAY; WHAT MEANINGS ARE ACCUMULATED ON THE JOURNEY FROM ONE COMMUNICATING BODY TO ANOTHER; WHAT HAPPENS TO MEANING ONCE THE MESSAGE ENTERS THE CHAOTIC ENVIRONMENT OF OUR RECEPTORS? WEINER USED THE INTERNATIONAL CODE OF SIGNALS – AN INDEX THAT ALREADY CHARTS THE HISTORICAL SHIFTS IN ENUNCIATIONS OF TRADE, NAVIGATION AND DISASTER FROM A COLONIAL ENTITY TO AN OTHER – AS A RESOURCE TO TEST THESE QUESTIONS. SHE WONDERED; THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED SINCE WW2. IN THE NEXT ETN [SIC] YEARS IT WILL DOUBLE AGAIN. HOW DO WE DEAL WITH IT? - DO WE USE MORE THAN THE 5% OF THE BRAIN NOW IN USE? - DO WE PROCESS QUICKER? - DO WE DECODE INFORMATION MORE AND PUT IT IN ANOTHER FORM (NOT LANGUAGE) SO THAT THE PRESENT BRAIN CAN HANDLE IT? ...IS THERE A CHANGE IN THE NEURAL CIRCUITS OF THE BRAIN? (WEINER 1969) THE QUESTION OF THE ‘PRESENT BRAIN’ UNDERGOING NEURAL REWIRING IN ORDER TO COPE WITH THE EXTRA LOAD OF DAILY, OR EVEN MINUTE-BY-MINUTE, INFORMATION MAY SOUND NAÏVE TO US CONTEMPORARY CONSUMERS OF INFORMATION. (I’M PRETTY SURE THE CONSENSUS IS THAT WE’VE USED THE SAME NEURAL SET-UP TO INTERPRET NOWADAYS INFORMATION FOR AS LONG AS WE HAVE BEEN READING THE STARS, TRACKING ANIMALS IN THE JUNGLE AND COMPREHENDING THE INTRICATE IDIOMS OF DRUM SIGNALS.) HOWEVER, WEINER’S PROPOSITION, OR EVEN ANXIETY, INVITES A RE-ACTIVATION OF CODE POEMS IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR PRESENTLY BRAINED RESOURCES. THEREFORE, IN A CONTEMPORARY READING OF CODE POEMS WE MIGHT ASK: WHAT IS A SIGNAL THAT TRAVERSES THE OCEAN OF GOOGLE SEARCH ALGORITHMS, THE MILIEU OF DIGITAL CODE SIGNALS, AND THE NAVIGATORY PROCESSES THAT SYNTHESISE (FEMALE) BODIES WITH THE MARKET ECONOMY? WE MIGHT ARGUE THAT THE EXPONENTIAL INCREASE OF AVAILABLE INFORMATION TO THE COMMON CONSUMER SINCE THE FIRST CODE POEMS PROJECT IS WAY BEYOND THAT IN THE LEAP BETWEEN WWII AND THE 1960S. THEREFORE TO RESEARCH AND RE-READ CODE POEMS NOW IS TO PERFORM AN ARRAY OF ANACHRONISTIC CONCEPTIONS, NAMELY AN ANACHRONISTIC CONCEPTUALISATION OF CODE. AS A MODERN DAY RESEARCHER AND POET, I USE WEINER’S PROJECT IN THE SAME WAY SHE USED THE NINETEENTH- CENTURY CODEX, AS A RESOURCE THROUGH WHICH TO STUDY THE CONTINGENT AND TIMELESS MECHANICS OF COMMUNICATION. WHERE THE ACT OF RESEARCH IS TO TREAT THE GIVEN MATERIAL AS ORACULAR THEN STUDYING THIS WORK IN PARTICULAR IS TO COMMUNICATE WITH IT, BE HAILED BY IT, AND ENTER INTO ITS CIRCUITRY OF SIGNALLING. IN RESPONSE I WANT TO LET MY MAGICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE CODE AND ITS SIGNAL RUN RIOT, OR LET TRAILS OF COMPREHENSION THAT ARE ACTIVATED BY THE MESSAGES PROVIDE A REACTIVE DISCOURSE TO THE SYSTEM OF ENUNCIATIONS OUTLINED BY WEINER. FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT IS IT TO BE PLUNDERED BY A PIRATE? INDEED THE MARITIME PRACTICE OF HIJACKING IS STILL IN PLACE, BUT ISN’T IT ALSO NOW TO BE LOOTED OF DATA? HOW IS THIS CONTEMPORARY READING REIMAGINED IN THE TEXT? THE BODY OF CODES AND LINGUISTIC SYMBOLS THAT WEINER USED ARE THE SAME, STATIC AND STANDARDISED, BUT THE VERNACULAR SHE HIGHLIGHTED HAS EVOLVED BEYOND ITSELF, WITH THE EXCESSES OF OUR OWN READING. CODE POEMS ILLUSTRATES THAT THERE ARE VARIOUS LAYERS OF OFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL MESSAGES BURIED WITHIN THE CODES THAT BETRAY THE INEVITABLE DIGRESSION OF MESSAGING AND THAT ‘WITHIN THEM LIE COMMUNIQUÉS OF AN ALTERNATE TOTALITY, HETEROGENEOUS AND COHERENT’ (GOLDMAN 2001, 125). WHAT SURFACES IN THE REWIRED PRONUNCIATION OF THE TEXT IS THE POETICS OF DISPLACED BODIES AND MESSAGES REMATERIALISED IN VARIOUS FORMS, DATA, PIXELS, FLESH, VOICE, FLAG WAVING, IMAGE, LOGO OR OTHERWISE. THE FLESHY PROPERTY OF CODE, AS USED BY WEINER, REMAINS ENCRYPTED WITH HISTORIES AND SIGNIFYING PROPERTIES. IN OTHER WORDS THE CODE IS MATTERED WITH THE RESIDUE OF ITS PREVIOUS FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS THE IMPORTED NINETEENTH-CENTURY IDIOM HEARD IN ‘PLUNDER’ OR ‘ARE THERE ANY OYSTERS TO BE HAD?’(WEINER 1982, 9) PERHAPS IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH AN ACT OF MAGICAL THINKING TO SUGGEST THAT THE LINGERING AND SHIFTING TEXTUALITIES IN THE CYPHERS MAKE THEM FEEL ALIVE – LIKE THEY ARE ADAPTING TO NEW HOST MEANINGS AND FUNCTIONS. THE COMMUNICATING SIGNALS (IN THIS FANTASTIC READING OF MINE) THEN BECOME NOT THE CALL OF DISTRESSED SHIPS, OR EVEN OF THE LYRICAL POET, BUT THE CALL OF CODE ITSELF. AFTER ALL, MUCH OF CODE POEMS AND ITS REENACTMENTS SEEM TO BE THE NOISE OF CODE TALKING TO ITSELF, SPEAKING OF ITS LACK, ITS NEED FOR INPUT, AND ITS DESIRE FOR A BODY. BRAVO LIMA DELTA: I AM A COMPLETE WRECK HD: CAN I TRANSFER RESCUED PERSONS TO YOU? AS I SEE IT THE COINCIDENCES OF CODE AND POETRY AS FRAMED BY WEINER LEAK OUT INTO ALL MANNER OF ARCHIVES. TRACES OF PREVIOUS POETIC UTTERANCES THREAD TOGETHER ALONG LINES OF TRANSMISSION – SOME OF WHICH DELIBERATELY INSTALLED BY WEINER, SOME OF WHICH CONTINUE TO BREED AND ARE REITERATED IN FRESH CONTEXTS. NEW LYRICISMS INTEGRATE WITH OLD. SIMILARLY WITHIN THE EXAMPLES OF DISTRESS CODE THAT WEINER IMPORTED INTO THE BOOK OF POETRY, WHAT LINGERS IS THE ‘ACTUAL’ MOMENT OF EMERGENCY. WEINER REARTICULATED DISTRESS CALLS AS POETRY THEREBY ALLOWING SHIPS’ CALLS TO ECHO THROUGH HER TEXT, CALLS THAT REMAIN PURELY IN THE STATE OF ECHO; OBSCURE AND TECHNICAL AS WELL AS NEEDY AND PERSONAL.
