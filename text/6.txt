THIS PUBLICATION IS THE RESULT OF A WIDE RANGE OF CROSS-DISCIPLINARY CONVERSATIONS, TAKING PLACE ACROSS SYMPOSIA, ONLINE FORUMS, LIVE EVENTS, AND WORKSHOPS, TO EXPLORE THE TWISTING TOGETHER OF MIND, LANGUAGE AND TECHNOLOGY. OUR INVESTIGATION INTO THIS COMBINATION OF THEMES HAS ITS ORIGINS IN A PREVIOUS PROJECT ENTITLED ELECTRONIC VOICE PHENOMENA (WWW.ELECTRONICVOICEPHENOMENA.NET), WHICH EXPLORES INTERFACES BETWEEN VOICE AND NEW TECHNOLOGY, AND ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE SUPERNATURAL. AS A SPLINTER ENQUIRY RESULTING FROM CONVERSATIONS AT AN EVP ‘THINK TANK’ SESSION IN 2012, WE BEGAN TO CONSIDER RESEARCH INTO HEARING VOICES AND SCHIZOPHRENIA, AND IT WAS THIS STRAND OF THOUGHT WHICH LED US TO THE WORK OF TIMOTHY CROW. CROW’S THEORY OF ‘CEREBRAL TORQUE’ POSITS SCHIZOPHRENIA AS A POSSIBLE SYMPTOM OF THE LATERALISATION OF BRAIN FUNCTION AND THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. THE WORD ‘TORQUE’, WITH ITS INFERENCE OF LANGUAGE IN MOTION AMONG THE CIRCUITRY OF THE BRAIN, AND OF TALKING, OFFERED A THEMATIC FULCRUM TO BUILD THE PROJECT AROUND. WE HAVE APPROPRIATED AND REDIRECTED ‘TORQUE’, FREEING IT FROM THE SPECIFICS OF CROW’S THEORY, BUT MAINTAINING ITS ESSENCE AS A TWISTING FORCE WITH ROOTS IN THE CONJUNCTION OF THE BRAIN AND LANGUAGE, AND WITH THE ADDITION OF A TECHNOLOGICAL DIMENSION – THE TWISTING OF WIRES, THE TORSION OF THE MACHINE. IN ESSENCE, CROW’S USE OF ‘CEREBRAL TORQUE’ ALLOWS HIM TO POSIT SCHIZOPHRENIA AS ‘THE PRICE HOMO SAPIENS PAY FOR LANGUAGE’. OUR USE OF THE TERM ALSO ALLOWS US TO ASK: WHAT, THEN, IS THE PRICE WE PAY FOR TECHNOLOGY? DOES DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY’S VIRUS-LIKE EMERGENCE FUNCTION LIKE THE ‘SPECIATION EVENT’, OR ACT LIKE A NEW LOBE OR TORSION IN THE BRAIN, FURTHER TWISTING ITS LATERALIZATIONS? IN AN ATTEMPT TO ARTICULATE A PARTICULAR TYPE OF MOVEMENT AND ENTWINING INHERENT WITHIN OUR RELATIONSHIP TO TECHNOLOGY, WE USE TORQUE TO IMPLY A ROTATING, SPIRAL LIKE FORCE, CAPABLE OF SIMULTANEOUSLY PULLING YOU IN AND SPITTING THINGS OUT; OF BOTH TIGHTENING AND LOOSENING; EXERTED BOTH UPON, AND FROM WITHIN, OURSELVES. TORQUE IS SUGGESTIVE OF OUR INTERDEPENDENT AND TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCE AND USE OF TECHNOLOGY WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BOTH DOMINATE AND EMANCIPATE, THROUGH FORCES THAT MORPH, DUPLICATE AND RECONFIGURE OUR ‘SELVES’, VIA ONLINE IDENTITIES AND MECHANICAL PROSTHESIS, WHERE MAN AND MACHINE CAN TRADE PLACES AS FULCRUM AND FORCE, TOOL AND MAKER. IN YET ANOTHER SENSE, TORQUE IS EVOCATIVE OF MORE DISTORTED, UNEXPECTED OR EVEN SINISTER FORCES AND MOVEMENTS – THE WORDS TORTURE AND TORMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, SHARE THEIR ETYMOLOGICAL ROOTS WITH TORQUE, FROM THE LATIN TORQUERE - TO TWIST. WHILE RETAINING OUR ORIGINAL INTEREST IN THE INTERRELATION OF MIND, LANGUAGE AND TECHNOLOGY, THE ENTITLING OF THE PROJECT HAS ACTED IN A CENTRIFUGAL MANNER, ALLOWING CONTRIBUTORS TO PROJECT THEIR IDEAS OUTWARD. IN SOME CASES THESE PROJECTIONS HEAD DEEP INTO HUMAN HISTORIES – ESTHER LESLIE DISCUSSES DANCER LOIE FULLER’S TWISTING SERPENTINE MOVEMENT OF SILKEN FABRIC AS A KIND OF PROTO-SCREEN OR PRECURSOR TO THE RAPTURE AND SPELL OF NEW MEDIA FORMS, OR LAMBROS MALAFOURIS USES THE FIGURE OF THE TURNING VASE TO ILLUSTRATE HIS NOTION OF THINKING AS THINGING. IN OTHERS, THE AUTHORS LOOK TO THE FUTURE – STEPHEN FORTUNE EXPLORES THE PERFECT STORM OF TRANSFORMATIVE TECHNOLOGIES EMERGING SINCE THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND INTO NEW LAYERINGS OF VIRTUAL, INFORMATIC AND GEO-POLITICAL TERRITORIES WHICH MAY LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT BIOLOGICAL SHIFT IN OUR BRAIN’S ABILITY TO ENABLE US TO THINK FOR OURSELVES; ALEX MCLEAN AND GEOFF COX DESCRIBE CONDITIONS IN WHICH CULTURAL OPERATIONS WITH ‘CODE’ CAN INFORM OUR RELATIONSHIP TO LANGUAGE AND POLITICAL AGENCY. MISAPPROPRIATION AND THE UNCANNY BECOME SYMPTOMS OF THE TORSIONS BETWEEN MIND, LANGUAGE AND TECHNOLOGY IN THE WORK OF HOLLY PESTER, WHO COMBINES HER OWN ARTISTIC MISUSE OF SEARCH ENGINES AND DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY WITH HANNAH WEINER’S TWISTED USE OF THE INTERNATIONAL CODE OF SIGNALS INTO LYRIC POETRY, AND IN CÉCILE B EVANS PRACTICE, WHO DIGITIZES AND RECASTS MUNDANE AND ALMOST TIMELESS HAND- HELD DEVICES – SCISSORS, A SCREW-DRIVER, A COMB – INTO DIGITAL FORM, PUSHING THEM ‘TO THEIR LIMITS’ AS THINGS, AND FINDING NEW EMOTIONALLY RICH TERRAIN FOR US TO EXPLORE. THROUGHOUT THE BOOK, WE HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED TO FIND UNEXPECTED OVERLAPS BETWEEN WORKS, WHICH FORM NEW AND GREATER RESONANCES FOR THE BOOK AS A WHOLE. ESTHER LESLIE’S LOOK BACK AT SERPENTINE DANCERS SPEAKS TO KATE SICCHIO’S TEXT IN WHICH SHE DISCUSSES HER WORK EXTENDING CHOREOGRAPHY INTO THE ARRANGEMENT AND CONTROL OF TECHNOLOGICAL INTERFACES. LAWRENCE ABU HAMDAN, HANNAH PROCTOR, AND IMOGEN STIDWORTHY EACH CRITIQUE FORMS OF VISUALIZATION IN TECHNOLOGICAL ANALYSIS, REFLECTING ON THE IDEOLOGICAL BAGGAGE THESE ENTICING FORMS OF ‘SEEING’ POSSESS - AND THE DELINEATIONS AND MODES OF CONTROL THEY IMPLY. HOLLY PESTER’S CODE POETRY UNEARTHS UNEXPECTED COLONIAL AND PATRIARCHAL INFERENCES SIMILARLY FOUND IN THE LANGUAGE OF BRAIN IMAGING DISCUSSED BY PROCTOR AND ABU HAMDAN. AND SO ON. THE INTER-RELATIONSHIPS FOR COGNITION AND TOOL ARE OF COURSE NOT A NEW PHENOMENA, AND NOR ARE THEY NEW MODES OF ENQUIRY. AS MALAFOURIS’ ESSAY ARTICULATES, TOOL MAKING AND USE, BRAINS, BODIES AND THINGS ARE IN A CONTINUAL STATE OF EXCHANGE, AND THE LINES BETWEEN MIND AND MATTER BLUR CONSIDERABLY. IN MALAFOURIS’ THEORISATIONS, AS WITH CÉCILE B EVAN’S ARTWORKS, WE SEE TOOLS, LANGUAGE AND THE MIND SHARE A GRAMMATICAL FORM – THEY SPEAK TO ONE ANOTHER, AND IN THIS SENSE IT MATTERS LESS WHICH CAME FIRST BECAUSE THEY CROSS FERTILISE AND INFORM ONE ANOTHER, THROUGH MUTUAL FEEDBACK AND CODEPENDENT EMERGENT PROCESSES, FORGING A GENERATIVE INTERACTION THAT IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS. IF LANGUAGE MOVES FLUIDLY ACROSS THE SENSES, FUNCTIONING NOT ONLY IN THE MIND, MOUTH AND EAR, BUT ALSO THE HAND AND EYE, AND EVOLUTION CAN TURN A LEG INTO A WING OR A WORM INTO AN HUMAN, THE QUESTION OF HOW WE MIGHT MERGE AND TWIST WITH MACHINES BECOMES LESS STRANGE AND MORE PERTINENT, PERHAPS. THIS PROJECT IS LESS ABOUT THE SPECULATIVE AND STEERS AWAY FROM SCIENCE FICTIONALISING LIFE, HOWEVER USEFUL SUCH REPRESENTATIONS ARE, TOWARDS MORE UNALLOYED ANALYSIS AND DEPICTION OF CONTEMPORARY EXISTENCE, EMPLOYING MORE HISTORICAL, MATERIALIST AND SCIENTIFIC EXAMINATIONS OF THE STATE OF THINGS. SUPPLEMENTING THE ESSAYS, WE HAVE INCLUDED A VARIETY OF ARTIST PAGES - SOME OF WHICH WERE PRESENTED AT THE SYMPOSIUM AND SOME AT THE LIVE PERFORMANCE EVENT. WE ARE PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT THE WORK OF KARL HEINZ JERON, CHRIS BOYD, CÉCILE B EVANS, AND BENEDICT DREW AS POWERFUL SEMIOTIC NODES AMONG THE MORE DISCURSIVE WORK. IN THE RESEARCH PROCESS WE ALSO ENCOUNTERED THE WORK OF EMIL ALZAMORA AND DENNIS OPPENHEIM AND WE INCLUDE THEIR WORK FOR ITS INSPIRATIONAL RESONANCES. AND A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO ANNA MUNSTER WHOSE SYMPOSIUM PRESENTATION FROM AUSTRALIA TRAVERSED MULTIPLE MEDIA, INCLUDING PRINTED MATTER, RECORDED VOICE AND SKYPE TO BRILLIANT EFFECT. THERE HAS ALSO BEEN A VERY GENEROUS RESPONSE TO THE PROJECT FROM THINKERS IN OUR IMMEDIATE CIRCLE IN LIVERPOOL AND LONDON, AND WE ARE GLAD TO INCLUDE NOTABLE CONTRIBUTIONS HERE FROM ROBERT SHEPPARD, RESPONDING TO THE TALK GIVEN BY LAMBROS MALAFOURIS AT THE SYMPOSIUM AND APPLYING IT TO THE FIELD OF EXPERIMENTAL POETICS, AND FROM MARK GREENWOOD WHO CONTRIBUTED AN UNFORGETTABLE THEATRICAL WORK WITH THE NODES AT OUR LIVE EVENT IN LONDON, AND DREW INTERESTING INFERENCES IN HIS Q&A WITH IMOGEN STIDWORTHY. ALSO THANKS TO STE COLE AND HANNAH SILVA WHO TRANSLATED WITH SKILL AND SENSITIVITY THE CONCERNS OF THE PROJECT INTO A NUMBER OF WORKSHOP SESSIONS, CO-PRODUCED WITH OURSELVES, AND CONGRATULATIONS ARE DUE TO ALL WHO PARTICIPATED IN THESE AND CREATED HIGHLY IMAGINATIVE WORKS THAT DEFTLY TWISTED MIND, LANGUAGE AND TECHNOLOGY, AND MADE THE WHOLE PROCESS A JOY. AS WE HAVE INDICATED, TORQUE, TORSION, AND TWISTING, ARE A GUIDING MOTIF FOR THE PROJECT – WITH ITS DIVERGENT TWIRLING STRANDS AND MULTI-PLATFORM CHARACTER WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE A DYNAMIC AND CUMULATIVE INTERPLAY BETWEEN DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES, PARTICIPANTS, PROCESSES AND MEDIA. THE SYMPOSIA, LIVE EVENTS, WORKSHOPS AND PUBLICATION HAVE ALL WORKED COLLECTIVELY TO INFORM AND CATALYSE ONE ANOTHER, AND WE HOPE THAT THIS PUBLICATION WITH ITS NEXUS OF IMAGERY AND THEORISATIONS CHANNELS THIS FURTHER. WE HOPE THIS PUBLICATION CONTRIBUTES SOMETHING TO THE DISCOURSE SURROUNDING THE PLASTICITY OF THE BRAIN, THE ADAPTABILITY OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE MALLEABILITY OF LANGUAGE, AND HOW EACH OFFER WITHIN THEM, AND IN THEIR CONFLATIONS, A POWERFUL POTENTIAL TO BE MOULDED, REIMAGINED, AND REDIRECTED. THE CONTRIBUTORS AND THEIR WORK PRESENTED EACH OFFER UNIQUE MODELS OF NAVIGATING THIS TERRITORY, OF MAKING THEIR OWN ARTEFACTS, WRITING THEIR OWN SCRIPTS, FORGING CRITICAL SPACE AND EXAMINING THE BLIND SPOTS. PLEASE NOTE ONE SPECIFIC TWIST TO THE USUAL FORMAT - WE HAVE ALLOWED AUTHORS TO USE THEIR PREFERRED REFERENCE FORMAT, RATHER THAN STIPULATING A SPECIFIC STYLE, THUS THE PUBLICATION SWITCHES BETWEEN ENDNOTES AND FOOTNOTES, CHICAGO AND HARVARD - THIS DECISION IS BASED ON THE INTERDISCIPLINARITY OF THE AUTHORS AND OUR CONFIDENCE IN READERS ABILITY TO ADAPT. WE WANT TO THANK ALL THOSE WHO DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE PROJECT AND PUBLICATION, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE NEW COMMISSIONS. AND SINCERE THANKS TO DESIGNER CHARLES HOLDEN AND OUR PROJECT PARTNERS AT FACT, MENCAP, RICH MIX, LINK EDITIONS AND ARTS COUNCIL ENGLAND. ALSO, TO THOSE WHOSE WORK WAS NOT PRESENT AT THE EVENTS BUT CONTRIBUTED TO THE PUBLICATION, INCLUDING: LAWRENCE ABU HAMDAN, ESTHER LESLIE, EMIL ALZAMORA AND AMY PLUMB OPPENHEIM FOR ASSISTANCE WITH DOCUMENTS RELATING TO DENNIS OPPENHEIM. ALSO THANK YOU TO CELLIST OLIVER COATES FOR HIS NEW SOUND WORK AND FOR HIS PERFORMANCE AT RICH MIX, ACCOMPANYING A NEW VIDEO WORK BY SAM SKINNER. THIS WORK, AND OTHER PROJECT DETAILS AND RESEARCH MATERIAL CAN BE FOUND AT: WWW.TORQUETORQUE.TUMBLR.COM TORQUE #1 IS WE HOPE THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING NEW. QUITE HOW IT WILL EVOLVE IS AS YET UNKNOWN BUT WE ENVISAGE A NOMADIC PROJECT THAT INHABITS AND PRODUCES PUBLICATIONS, SYMPOSIA, INSTALLATIONS AND EVENTS, IN COLLABORATION WITH INDIVIDUALS, ORGANISATIONS AND PLACES, CROSSING THE FIELDS OF ART, SCIENCE AND CONTEMPORARY CULTURE – AND IN SO DOING PROMOTE SIGNIFICANTLY NEW MODES OF THINKING, DOING AND BEING.
